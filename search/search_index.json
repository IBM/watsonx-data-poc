Usually this location is your workstation, but it could be another service like CP4D. To extract the certificate to your local file system, use the following command in a terminal window. Replace the port and regions.techzone-server.com with the SSH values found in the TechZone reservation. scp -P port watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/certs/presto-key.jks /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! You can also download the certificate by using the Jupyter Notebook link and opening the Credentials notebook. There you will find links to the certificates. Watsonx.data Presto Access When connecting to the Presto engine, choose the PrestoDB driver. Presto Internal Access For local access the following credentials are used: Hostname: localhost Port: 8443 Username: ibmlhadmin Password: password Database: tpch In addition, you need to set the following driver properties: SSL True SSLTrustStorePath /certs/presto-key.jks SSLTrustStorePassword watsonx.data Presto External Access The watsonx.data Presto database requires that the certificate be extracted from the image. See the section above on Connection Certificate for more details. In the following settings, remember to update the Hostname and Port to the values provided in your TechZone reservation.

Db2 Access When connecting to the Db2 engine, select the Db2 LUW driver. Db2 Internal Access The Db2 server can be accessed on port 50000 inside the virtual machine using the following credentials: Hostname - watsonxdata Port - 50000 Username - db2inst1 Password - db2inst1 Database - gosales SSL - off Db2 External Access When accessing the database outside the virtual machine, you must change the host to region.techzone-server.com and the port number based on your TechZone reservation. All the other settings remain the same. Hostname - region.techzone-server.com Port - port Username - db2inst1 Password - db2inst1 Database - gosales SSL - off PostgreSQL Access When connecting to the PostgreSQL engine, select the PostgreSQL driver. In order to connect to the PostgreSQL system, you will need to extract the admin password using the following command when connected to the watsonx.data system. cat /certs/passwords You can also retrieve the credentials by opening up the Credentials notebook in the Jupyter notebook service. PostgreSQL Internal Access When accessing the PostgreSQL database in the system, use the following settings. Hostname \u2013 ibm-lh-postgres Port \u2013 5432 Username \u2013 admin Password \u2013 The value that was extracted in the earlier step Database \u2013 gosales PostgreSQL External Access The following credentials are used for remote access.

Adding a Database to watsonx.data When adding a database engine to the watsonx.data system, make sure to change the database display name since that needs to be unique. For instance, when you add gosales database from Db2 to the system, the display name could be gosales as well. However, if you now add the PostgreSQL database to the system, the display name cannot be the same. You may want to differentiate databases with the same name by prefixing them with the database type. For instance, the gosales database could be shown as db2_gosales or pg_gosales so that you keep the names distinct. Once a database has been added, make sure to wait for a few moments before attempting to access the database. The Presto server takes a few moments to start up. To make sure that it is running, run the check_presto command in a terminal window and wait until it says the service is ready. When attempting to view the contents of a new database, the process may take a few minutes to complete. Refresh the browser window if you haven't seen any changes to the display. Accessing watsonx.data via Python In order to access the watsonx.data database (Presto), you will need to install the Presto client using the following command on your local machine. pip3 install presto-python-client Once the installation is complete, extract the certificate from the watsonx.data server that we will use in the connection. scp -P port watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/certs/presto-key.jks /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! You can also download the certificate by using the Jupyter Notebook link and opening the Certificate notebook. Python and Jupyter Connection Code Your Python or Jupyter notebook code will need to import the prestodb library and then connect to watsonx.data using the connect call. import prestodb conn = prestodb.dbapi.connect( host='watsonxdata', port=8443, user='ibmlhadmin', catalog='tpch', schema='tiny', http_scheme='https', auth=prestodb.auth.BasicAuthentication(\"ibmlhadmin\", \"password\") ) conn._http_session.verify = '/certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt' cur = conn.cursor() In the above connection string, you will need to replace the following values: host - watsonxdata when connecting to the image externally, and ibm-lh-presto-svc when connecting internally catalog - What is the name of the catalog that we are accessing schema - The schema inside the catalog that will be used You also need to update the conn._http_session.verify value with the location where you downloaded the lh-ssl-ts.crt file. For internal connections, this value will be /certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt . Once connected, you can run an SQL statement and return the results. cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM tpch.tiny.customer\") rows = cur.fetchall() The rows variable contains the answer set from the select statement. You can manipulate the row variable to view the results. rows[0] [1, 'Customer#000000001', 'IVhzIApeRb ot,c,E', 15, '25-989-741-2988', 711.56, 'BUILDING', 'to the even, regular platelets. regular, ironic epitaphs nag e'] The PrestoDB driver supports the DBAPI spec. For more details on the use of the DBAPI interface, please refer to https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/ . For instance, if you want to find the description of the columns returned, you would use the description function. cur.description [('custkey', 'bigint', None, None, None, None, None), ('name', 'varchar(25)', None, None, None, None, None), ('address', 'varchar(40)', None, None, None, None, None), ('nationkey', 'bigint', None, None, None, None, None), ('phone', 'varchar(15)', None, None, None, None, None), ('acctbal', 'double', None, None, None, None, None), ('mktsegment', 'varchar(10)', None, None, None, None, None), ('comment', 'varchar(117)', None, None, None, None, None)] Accessing watsonx.data via Pandas Dataframes The following code is required for accessing watsonx.data in Jupyter notebooks. Run the following code inside a notebook code cell. %pip install ipython-sql==0.4.1 %pip install sqlalchemy==1.4.46 %pip install sqlalchemy==1.4.46 \"pyhive[presto]\" The notebook may need a restart of the kernel to pick up the changes to the driver. If you are running in a Jupyter Lab environment, you can use the most current versions of the drivers. %pip install ipython-sql %pip install sqlalchemy %pip install sqlalchemy \"pyhive[presto]\" Once the drivers have been loaded, you will need to extract the certificate from the watsonx.data server that we will use in the connection. scp -P port watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/certs/presto-key.jks /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! You can also download the certificate by using the Jupyter Notebook link and opening the Certificate notebook. In your Jupyter notebook, you will need to import a number of libraries. import pandas as pd import sqlalchemy from sqlalchemy import create_engine Create a notebook cell which will contain all the credentials that are required to connect. Change the catalog , schema and certfile to your values. userid = \"ibmlhadmin\" password = \"password\" hostname = \"watsonxdata\" port = \"8443\" catalog = \"tpch\" schema = \"tiny\" certfile = \"/certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt\" connect_args={ 'protocol': 'https', 'requests_kwargs': {'verify': f'{certfile}'} } In the above settings, you will need to replace the following values: hostname - region.techzone-server.com when connecting to the image externally, and ibm-lh-presto-svc when connecting internally catalog - What is the name of the catalog that we are accessing schema - The schema inside the catalog that will be used You also need to update the certfile value with the location where you downloaded the lh-ssl-ts.crt file. For internal connections, this value will be /certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt . To create a connection to the database, use the following syntax. engine = create_engine( f\"presto://{userid}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{catalog}/{schema}\", connect_args=connect_args ) Now that you have established a connection, you can use the Pandas read_sql_query function to execute a SELECT statement against the database. mypresto = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * from tpch.tiny.customer',engine) The variable mypresto contains the dataframe generated from the SELECT statement. mypresto You can use the features of Pandas to generate plots of the data in your notebook. First make sure you have matplotlib installed. %pip install matplotlib The following query will compute the total account balance across all nation key values. sumbynation = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT \"nationkey\", sum(\"acctbal\") from tpch.tiny.customer group by \"nationkey\" order by 2',engine) Finally, we plot the results. df.plot(kind=\"bar\", x=\"FirstName\", y=\"LastName\") plt.show() Adding a Service The watsonx.data developer edition includes two open ports which can be used to externalize a service that you create in the image. For instance, you may choose to create a MongoDB or MSSQL container using Docker and want to access this service from your own dBeaver or Mongo tooling. Since port numbers vary between different databases, the watsonx.data system provides two port numbers that can be used by your service. Open Port 1 - Server: region.techzone-services.com: Port: 12345 Open Port 2 - Server: region.techzone-services.com: Port: 23456 The internal port numbers are 10000 (Port 1) and 10001 (Port 2). The following steps are required to use these ports with your service. Open the local Firewall Ports 10000/1 are not open by default in the image. You must explicitly open these ports with the firewall-cmd command. In a command line shell, as the root user, enter the following commands: sudo su - firewall-cmd --add-port={10000/tcp,10001/tcp} --zone=public --permanent firewall-cmd --reload You can use the following command to check that the ports are now open. firewall-cmd --list-ports Create your Service When creating your service, make sure to map the internal Docker port to either port 10000 or 10001. If you cannot remap the port, see the section on port redirection. For instance, the following command will start Microsoft SQLServer in Docker by mapping the host port 10000 to the SQLServer port of 1433 to 10000 ( -p 10000:1443 ). docker run -e \"ACCEPT_EULA=Y\" -e \"MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Passw0rd12345678!\" \\ -p 10000:1433 --name mssql-server --hostname mssql-server \\ -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest You can check the port mapping with the following command. docker container ls --format \"table {{.ID}}\\t{{.Names}}\\t{{.Ports}}\" -a | grep mssql-server When creating a connection to this database using an external tool, make sure to use the port number supplied in the reservation details (Open Port 1 is for port 10000 and Open Port 2 is for port 10001). Port Redirection If you already have an existing service mapped to a different port, you can use port redirection to use either port 10000 or 10001. For instance, assume that the previous creation of the SQLServer database used port 1433. docker run -e \"ACCEPT_EULA=Y\" -e \"MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Passw0rd12345678!\" \\ -p 1433:1433 --name mssql-server --hostname mssql-server \\ -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest Once the service is up and running, you can redirect the traffic on port 10000/1 to the port of your docker service. firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=10000:proto=tcp:toport=1433 --permanent --zone=public firewall-cmd --reload If you need to remove the redirection, use the following command. firewall-cmd --remove-forward-port=port=10000:proto=tcp:toport=1433:toaddr= --permanent --zone=public firewall-cmd --reload Accessing your Service When referring to your service from an external location, always use the port numbers that are provided for Open Port 1 or 2. Open Port 1 - Server: region.techzone-services.com: Port: 12345 Open Port 2 - Server: region.techzone-services.com: Port: 23456 Your server will be region.techzone-services.com and the port number will be either of the two port numbers provided. Remember that this port number will need to be opened in the server and a Docker mapping to the open port or a firewall port redirection will be required.","title":"Database Connections"},{"location":"wxd-connections/#database-connections","text":"There are three database systems that can be accessed inside and outside the virtual machine environment: watsonx.data Presto, Db2 LUW, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

To create a connection to the database, use the following syntax. engine = create_engine( f\"presto://{userid}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{catalog}/{schema}\", connect_args=connect_args ) Now that you have established a connection, you can use the Pandas read_sql_query function to execute a SELECT statement against the database. mypresto = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * from tpch.tiny.customer',engine) The variable mypresto contains the dataframe generated from the SELECT statement. mypresto You can use the features of Pandas to generate plots of the data in your notebook. First make sure you have matplotlib installed. %pip install matplotlib The following query will compute the total account balance across all nation key values. sumbynation = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT \"nationkey\", sum(\"acctbal\") from tpch.tiny.customer group by \"nationkey\" order by 2',engine) Finally, we plot the results. df.plot(kind=\"bar\", x=\"FirstName\", y=\"LastName\") plt.show()","title":"Accessing watsonx.data via Pandas Dataframes"},{"location":"wxd-connections/#adding-a-service","text":"The watsonx.data developer edition includes two open ports which can be used to externalize a service that you create in the image.

Since port numbers vary between different databases, the watsonx.data system provides two port numbers that can be used by your service. Open Port 1 - Server: region.techzone-services.com: Port: 12345 Open Port 2 - Server: region.techzone-services.com: Port: 23456 The internal port numbers are 10000 (Port 1) and 10001 (Port 2).

Check out the following websites for a variety of public data sets that you can use. Awesome Public Datasets Kaggle Datasets US Data.Gov UCI Machine Learning Repository US Fuel Economy Note : These sites have not been checked for license restrictions on the use of the data. You are responsible for checking that the data can be used without any licensing requirements. Loading your own data You can use a browser or link to an external file repository (i.e., Box) and download data directly to your workstation. Data can be CSV, Parquet, JSON, or TXT formats. Once the data is on your workstation, use the following steps. Note : You cannot import customer data nor any data that has restrictions associated with its use. Any use of private data is in violation of the terms and conditions of using this image. The first step is to connect to MinIO. Extract the MinIO credentials by using the passwords command: passwords Open your browser and navigate to the MinIO console. Login with object store credentials found above (These will be different for your system). You should see the current buckets in MinIO. If you don't see the buckets, click on Object Browser on the left-hand side panel. Select hive-bucket from the list of buckets. You may see other directories in this list than what is shown above. You will need to create a new path for your data set. Create a new directory name for your data (fuel_economy was used for this example). MinIO will display an empty directory and suggest you load something into it. Use the Upload button on the far right side to point to your dataset on your local machine. In this example, we are using a CSV file for the 2013 fuel economy estimates for automobiles sold in the US. You may need to rename you datasets to eliminate blanks and any other special characters other than \" _ \" or \" - \". The display will show the progress of the upload into the bucket. You may need to refresh your browser to see the file in the bucket. Now that the data has been loaded into a bucket, you can catalog it in the watsonx.data UI. If you created a new bucket for this data set, you will need to register it first in the watsonx.data UI. Instructions for how to do this are found in the Working with Object Store Buckets section. Start by navigating to the watsonx.data UI and look at the Infrastructure manager. Find the bucket where you upload your data set into and note the catalog name that it is associated with. Here we can see that the hive-bucket bucket is associated with the hive_data catalog. In the watsonx.data UI, select the Query workspace (SQL) icon. You will need to create a schema that links to this data set. The format of the command is shown below. DROP SCHEMA catalog.schema_name; CREATE SCHEMA catalog.schema_name WITH ( location = 's3a://your-bucket/data_directory' ); You will need to change the following values: catalog - The catalog that the bucket you are using is associated with schema_name - A schema name to associate your tables with data_directory - The directory in which your file is located your_bucket - The bucket the data physically resides in For the fuel economy example, using mpg as the schema, the SQL would be: DROP SCHEMA hive_data.mpg; CREATE SCHEMA hive_data.mpg WITH ( location = 's3a://hive-bucket/fuel_economy' ); Run this SQL against the Presto engine: The DROP command may fail if the schema doesn't exist, but the CREATE should work. The next step is to define what the table looks like for watsonx.data to be able to query it. The syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement is similar to: CREATE TABLE catalog.schema.tablename ( \"column_name\" \"type\", ... ) WITH ( format = 'CSV', csv_separator = ',', external_location = 's3a://your_bucket/data_directory'); You will need to create a table definition for your CSV file in order to catalog it in watsonx.data. Note that the only data type that is permitted for CSV columns is varchar . This is a restriction of the current driver. Plans are to update it to include other data types over time. If your data set does not include a header row (a row that defines the column names), you will need to create the table definition manually. If the data set does contain a header record, you can use the following Python code to generate a CREATE TABLE statement. You will need to make sure that pandas is available. python3 -m pip install pandas --user Next run the python3 command in the shell to run an interactive Python session. python3 Place the following code into your Python window. def showcsv(catalog, schema, tablename, bucket, directory, csv_in): import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(csv_in,na_values=\"-\") df = df.fillna(0) column_headers = list(df.columns.values) print(\"\") print(f\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {catalog}.{schema}.{tablename};\") print(f\"CREATE TABLE {catalog}.{schema}.{tablename}\") print(\" (\") comma = \"\" end = \"\" for header in column_headers: print(f\"{comma}\",end=end) comma = \",\" end = \"\\n\" print(f' \"{header}\" varchar',end=\"\") print(f\" )\") print(f\"WITH (\") print(f\" format = 'CSV',\") print(f\" csv_separator = ',',\") print(f\" external_location = 's3a://{bucket}/{directory}'\") print(f\" );\") print(\"\") def makesql(): catalog = input(\"Catalog : \") schema = input(\"Schema : \") table = input(\"Table : \") bucket = input(\"Bucket : \") dir = input(\"Directory : \") csv = input(\"CSV File : \") showcsv(catalog,schema,table,bucket,dir,csv) Gather the following information on your dataset: catalog - The catalog the schema and table are created under ( hive_data ) schema - The schema name that you created to hold your table ( mpg ) table name - The name of the table ( fuel_economy ) bucket - Where the data is located ( hive-bucket ) directory - What directory contains your data ( fuel_economy ) csv_in - The location on your local machine where the csv file is Once you have gathered that, run the following command in your Python window and answer the prompts. makesql() >>> makesql() Catalog : hive_data Schema : mpg Table : fueleconomy Bucket : hive-bucket Directory : fuel_economy CSV File : ~/Downloads/fuel_economy_2013.csv DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hive_data.mpg.fueleconomy; CREATE TABLE hive_data.mpg.fueleconomy ( \"MODEL_YEAR\" varchar, \"MFR_NAME\" varchar, \"DIVISION\" varchar, \"CARLINE\" varchar, \"ENG_DISPL\" varchar, \"CYL\" varchar, \"TRANS_IN_FE_GUIDE\" varchar, \"CITY_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"HWY_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"COMB_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"AIR_ASPIRATION_DESC\" varchar, \"TRANS_DESC\" varchar, \"GEARS\" varchar, \"DRIVE_DESC\" varchar, \"FUEL_UNIT_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"FUEL_UNIT_DESC_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"ANNUAL_FUEL_COST_CONVENTIONAL\" varchar, \"FUEL_METERING_SYS_DESC\" varchar ) WITH ( format = 'CSV', csv_separator = ',', external_location = 's3a://hive-bucket/fuel_economy' ); Cut and paste the output from the command into the watsonx.data Data Explorer window to create the file.

To access dBeaver, you must use the VNC service which has been installed on this server for you. Start dBeaver Locally (VNC) To start dBeaver, you must be connected to the console of the Linux server as the watsonx user. In the virtual machine, click on the Applications button, choose the Database folder and click on the dBeaver icon. The start-up screen for dBeaver will display. The dBeaver program may ask if you want to create an empty database or update the release. Just say No. The first dialog from dBeaver will ask you to create a database connection. If you do not see this screen, select Database, and then select New Database Connection: Catalog watsonx.data Connection We will use the PrestoDB JDBC connector (NOT PrestoSQL). This is the other name for Trino, a variant of PrestoDB which might work. Select SQL (see Left side) and scroll down until you see PrestoDB. Select PrestoDB and then press \u201cNext\u201d.

Add another field called SSLTrustStorePath and give it value of /certs/presto-key.jks and finally add the SSLTrustStorePassword setting with a value of watsonx.data . The panel should now contain three values. Press Finish when done. You should now see the TPCH database on the left panel. Clicking on the >TPCH line should display the objects that are found in the database. You can now use dBeaver to navigate through the different schemas in the Presto database.

Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application. It is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data, from simple pie charts to highly detailed geospatial charts. Application Programming Interface (API)**: Application Programming Interface (API) is a programmatic interface for executing functions of an application in an automated or manual fashion without using a CLI or User Interface. Buckets : Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data. Everything that you store in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. You can use buckets to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike directories and folders, you cannot nest buckets. Catalog : This term may have many meanings depending on context. Review below: Service Catalog - A service catalog is a comprehensive list of cloud computing services that an organization offers its customers. The catalog is the only portion of the company's service portfolio that is published and provided to customers as a support to the sale or delivery of offered services. Data Catalog - A collection of business information describing the available datasets within an organization. Metastore Catalog - A collection of technical and operational metadata allowing a query engine to overlay a virtual table on a collection of discrete data files. Connector Catalog - The named representation of a connector within the virtual warehouse of a presto instance. Command Line Interface (CLI) : A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. dBeaver : DBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool. For relational databases it uses the JDBC application programming interface to interact with databases via a JDBC driver. For other databases it uses proprietary database drivers. Federation : A federated database is a system in which several databases appear to function as a single entity. Each component database in the system is completely self-sustained and functional. When an application queries the federated database, the system figures out which of its component databases contains the data being requested and passes the request to it. Federated databases can be thought of as database virtualization in much the same way that storage virtualization makes several drives appear as one. MinIO : MinIO is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It runs on-prem and on any cloud (public or private) and from the data center to the edge. MinIO is software-defined and open source under GNU AGPL v3. Object Storage : Object storage is a data storage architecture for storing unstructured data, which sections data into units\u2014objects\u2014and stores them in a structurally flat data environment. Each object includes the data, metadata, and a unique identifier that applications can use for easy access and retrieval. Presto : Presto is a distributed database query engine (written in Java) that uses the SQL query language. Its architecture allows users to query data sources such as Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka, AWS S3, Alluxio, MySQL, MongoDB and Teradata, and allows use of multiple data sources within a query. Presto is community-driven open-source software released under the Apache License. Presto's architecture is very similar to other database management systems using cluster computing, sometimes called massively parallel processing (MPP). SPARK : Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark can be used with watsonx.data but is not included in the watsonsx.data environment image provided. TechZone (IBM Technology Zone) : IBM Technology Zone is the platform where the developer edition of watsonx.data with the sample data sets has been provisioned. Generally, it allows Go To Market teams and Business Partners to easily build technical 'Show Me' live environments, POTs, prototypes, and MVPs, which can then be customized and shared with peers and customers to experience IBM Technology. VNC (Virtual Network Computing) : VNC is a cross-platform screen-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol. VNC was created to control another computer remotely. You may know it best for its role in tech support services. Use of VNC is optional. VNC can be used after the WireGuard VPN has been activated to access the watsonx.data server. WireGuard : WireGuard is a communication protocol and free and open-source software that implements encrypted virtual private networks, and was designed with the goals of ease of use, high speed performance, and low attack surface. You will need to install the Wireguard software and download the server VPN certificate in order to access the watsonx.data server.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"wxd-glossary/#glossary","text":"Apache Superset : Apache Superset is an open-source software application for data exploration and data visualization able to handle data at petabyte scale.

The catalog is the only portion of the company's service portfolio that is published and provided to customers as a support to the sale or delivery of offered services. Data Catalog - A collection of business information describing the available datasets within an organization. Metastore Catalog - A collection of technical and operational metadata allowing a query engine to overlay a virtual table on a collection of discrete data files. Connector Catalog - The named representation of a connector within the virtual warehouse of a presto instance. Command Line Interface (CLI) : A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. dBeaver : DBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool. For relational databases it uses the JDBC application programming interface to interact with databases via a JDBC driver. For other databases it uses proprietary database drivers. Federation : A federated database is a system in which several databases appear to function as a single entity. Each component database in the system is completely self-sustained and functional. When an application queries the federated database, the system figures out which of its component databases contains the data being requested and passes the request to it. Federated databases can be thought of as database virtualization in much the same way that storage virtualization makes several drives appear as one. MinIO : MinIO is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It runs on-prem and on any cloud (public or private) and from the data center to the edge. MinIO is software-defined and open source under GNU AGPL v3. Object Storage : Object storage is a data storage architecture for storing unstructured data, which sections data into units\u2014objects\u2014and stores them in a structurally flat data environment. Each object includes the data, metadata, and a unique identifier that applications can use for easy access and retrieval. Presto : Presto is a distributed database query engine (written in Java) that uses the SQL query language. Its architecture allows users to query data sources such as Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka, AWS S3, Alluxio, MySQL, MongoDB and Teradata, and allows use of multiple data sources within a query. Presto is community-driven open-source software released under the Apache License. Presto's architecture is very similar to other database management systems using cluster computing, sometimes called massively parallel processing (MPP). SPARK : Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark can be used with watsonx.data but is not included in the watsonsx.data environment image provided. TechZone (IBM Technology Zone) : IBM Technology Zone is the platform where the developer edition of watsonx.data with the sample data sets has been provisioned. Generally, it allows Go To Market teams and Business Partners to easily build technical 'Show Me' live environments, POTs, prototypes, and MVPs, which can then be customized and shared with peers and customers to experience IBM Technology. VNC (Virtual Network Computing) : VNC is a cross-platform screen-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol. VNC was created to control another computer remotely. You may know it best for its role in tech support services. Use of VNC is optional. VNC can be used after the WireGuard VPN has been activated to access the watsonx.data server. WireGuard : WireGuard is a communication protocol and free and open-source software that implements encrypted virtual private networks, and was designed with the goals of ease of use, high speed performance, and low attack surface. You will need to install the Wireguard software and download the server VPN certificate in order to access the watsonx.data server.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"wxd-ingest/","text":"Ingesting Data In this lab we will use the ingest tool (lh-tool) alongside the IBM watsonx.data developer edition that is running in this lab. The Ingest tool is a separate install and currently needs to be downloaded after IBM watsonx.data is started. The lab image contains a copy of this code so you will not need to download it.

Presto Magic Commands Magic commands are special macros found in Jupyter notebooks that simplify many tasks, including the ability to run SQL commands against a database. This notebook provides an introduction to what magic commands are and how you can use the Presto magic commands to connect and query the Presto database. Introduction to Presto SQL The watsonx.data lab has two ways of running SQL against the Presto database: Presto CLI commands Python/Pandas/Magic commands This notebook contains all the SQL that is run in the Presto SQL section of the lab. Instead of using the presto-cli command, this notebook uses magic commands to simplify the SQL execution. You can choose either method to explore Presto SQL. Presto Federation Presto provides the ability to federate queries across different servers. This notebook explores the ability to federate a PostgreSQL table with a table found in Presto. This lab requires some knowledge of the watsonx.data UI, so it is recommended you become familiar with the UI before running this lab. Python with watsonx.data Accessing the Presto database in Python requires the use of the prestodb module which implements features of the DBAPI standard. The notebook demonstrates how to connect to the database and retrieve results. Pandas Dataframes with watsonx.data Pandas dataframes are commonly used in Jupyter notebooks to analyze data. This code will connect to Presto using a Pandas dataframe and display some data from an existing table that was created in Presto. Note that the certificate required for this notebook is provided in the environment. Accessing watsonx.data with Spark This notebook demonstrates how Spark can connect to watsonx.data and manipulate the data. This system has a local, minimally configured Spark engine that will be used to access the Presto database. This engine is sufficient to demonstrate the steps needed to connect to watsonx.data and access the data that resides in the Presto catalogs.

The Safari browser is much more reliable. Login with object store credentials found above (These will be different for your system). You should see current buckets in MinIO. We are going to examine these buckets after we populate them with some data. Creating Schemas and Tables Not all catalogs support creation of schemas - as an example, the TPCH catalog is not writeable. We will use the iceberg_data catalog for this exercise. We will need to get some details before we continue. Make sure you are connected as the root user and are in the proper directory. cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin Login to the Presto CLI. ./presto-cli --catalog iceberg_data Create schema workshop in catalog iceberg_data .

You should now see new objects under iceberg-bucket Click on the bucket name and you will see the customer table. Selecting the customer object will show that there is data and metadata in there. How do we know that this data is based on Apache iceberg? If you open the file under metadata , you should see metadata information for the data we are storing in parquet file format. Do I really need Apache Iceberg? YES, YOU DO! However, it is good to understand why? Metadata is also stored in the Parquet file format but only for the single parquet file. If we add more data/partitions, the data is split into multiple Parquet files, and we don't have a mechanism to get the table to parquet files mapping. Run the following example to understand this better. You need to get the access keys for MinIO before running the following lab.

Exit from the Sandbox. exit MinIO CLI The MinIO Client mc command line tool provides an alternative to UNIX commands like ls , cat , cp , mirror , and diff with support for both file systems and Amazon S3-compatible cloud storage services. The mc commandline tool is built for compatibility with the AWS S3 API and is tested with MinIO and AWS S3 for expected functionality and behavior. Complete details and restrictions around the use of the CLI command can be found on the MinIO Client page. You can use the MinIO CLI from a variety of clients. The MinIO ports are open in the developer edition image, which provides an alternative to loading data directly from your workstation rather than using the MinIO UI interface. Minio System Alias Before running commands against the MinIO server, an alias must be created that includes the access and secret key. The values can be extracted from the system by listing the contents of the /certs/passwords file or by running the passwords command as the root user. cat /certs/passwords The values for the MinIO access and secret key can also be exported with the following code: export LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY | sed 's/.*=//') export LH_S3_SECRET_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_SECRET_KEY | sed 's/.*=//') echo \"MinIO Userid : \" $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY echo \"MinIO Password: \" $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY The alias command has the following syntax: mc alias set alias-name hostname:port access_key secret_key For a local connection, we will use the following values: Alias Name - watsonxdata Hostname \u2013 watsonxdata Port \u2013 9000 Access Key \u2013 $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY Secret Key - $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY If you are using an external client to connect to the MinIO service, you will need the URL and Port number from the TechZone reservation. The access key and secret key will be the same values that are found above. Hostname \u2013 region.techzone-server.com Port \u2013 12345 The alias for local access is found below. mc alias set watsonxdata http://watsonxdata:9000 $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY Added `watsonxdata` successfully. List Buckets The mc command provides us with a number of commands that allows us to manage buckets and files within them. The following command checks to see what buckets currently exist in the system. mc ls tree watsonxdata [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B hive-bucket/ [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B iceberg-bucket/ You can view the contents of a bucket by traversing down the path. mc ls tree watsonxdata/hive-bucket [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B gosalesdw/ [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B hive_sql/ [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B ontime/ [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B taxi/ Create a Bucket At this point we will create a new bucket to hold some data. Use the mb (make bucket) command. The command requires the alias name for the MinIO connection followed by the name of the bucket. mc mb alias-name/new-bucket The following code will create a new bucket in the system called sampledata . mc mb watsonxdata/sampledata Bucket created successfully `watsonxdata/sampledata`. We can double check that the bucket it there. mc ls tree watsonxdata [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B hive-bucket/ [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B iceberg-bucket/ [2023-10-13 10:39:47 EDT] 0B sampledata/ Loading Data One of the most powerful features of the MinIO CLI is its ability to load data directory from your workstation into the bucket, rather than having to use the MinIO UI. It is also significantly faster than using the UI interface. The next example will load data into the bucket that was just created.

Access to a terminal window can be accomplished in the three ways as described below: Use the SSH Command Locally Use SSH Browser Window Terminal window in the VM If you are unable to use ssh because of connection restrictions, the Browser Window SSH option is the easiest one to use. SSH Command Your TechZone reservation will include the server name and port number to use when connecting using ssh. The port number is referred to as port in the command below, while the server will be referred to as region.techzone-server.com . Replace these values with those found in your reservation. You have the choice of using the VM Remote console and logging in as the watsonx user to issues commands, or using a local terminal shell (iTerm, Hyper, terminal) to run commands against the watsonx.data server. You can have multiple connections into the machine at any one time. It will be easier to cut-and-paste commands into a local terminal shell. The VM Remote Console does not support cut-and-paste operation from outside the virtual console environment. Open a terminal window and use the following syntax to connect as the watsonx userid. ssh -p port watsonx@region.techzone-server.com The port number and server name are provided as part of the TechZone reservation details. To become the root user, issue the following command. sudo su - Password for both users is watsonx.data . Web Browser Terminal An SSH service in a browser window is provided in this image. As part of the reservation, you will see a URL with the following description: SSH Browser - http://region.techzone-server.com:port When you first click on this link, the browser will display a login prompt. The userid is watsonx and the password is watsonx.data . Once you press the Sign in button, you will see a blank display. Press the browser \"refresh\" button, and you should see the login prompt. Patience! Sometimes it takes a few \"refresh\" commands to get the login prompt to display. It may take 5-6 attempts before it wakes up. Don't give up too soon! It will eventually display the login prompt. The userid is watsonx and the password is watsonx.data . You are now using a terminal session inside the watsonx.data server. Since you have logged in as the watsonx user, you must use the sudo su - command to become the root user. Note that you are not in the correct directory to run commands. You must issue the following command to be in the command directory. cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin Cut and Paste The Browser SSH screen supports full cut and paste operations. This makes it easy to copy scripts into this window without having to retype the commands. All the commands in the lab can now be run from within this browser rather than using the VM Remote console. If at any time you accidentally close this window, you can open another one using the SSH browser link in the reservation. Terminal Window in the VM If you use the Remote VM Console , you can log into the watsonx.data user and use a Terminal shell to run commands against the watsonx.data server. Select the Terminal application in the virtual machine to issue commands. This will open up the terminal window. At this point you are connected as the watsonx user. You can ignore any lab instructions that ask you to ssh into the watsonx server. To become the root user, you must enter the following command in the terminal window. sudo su - Now as the root user you will be ready to run the commands found in the lab. Cut and Paste The VM Remote Console does not support cut and paste operations from outside the VM environment. Cut and paste is supported inside the virtual machine, but attempting to paste something from you workstation into the VM Console will fail. Copying Files If you need to move files into or out of the virtual machine, you can use the following commands. To copy a file into the virtual machine use the following syntax: scp -P port myfile.txt watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/tmp/myfile.txt The filename myfile.txt will be copied to the /tmp directory. The temporary directory is useful since you can copy the file to multiple places from within the Linux environment. Multiple files can be moved by using wildcard characters using the following syntax: scp -P port myfile.* watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/tmp To move files from the image back to your local system requires you reverse the file specification. scp -P port watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/tmp/myfile.txt /Downloads/myfile.txt You can also use wildcards to select more than one file.","title":"SSH and SCP Commands"},{"location":"wxd-reference-ssh/#ssh-access","text":"All the commands in the lab will require you execute commands in a terminal window.

Here is a list of common questions, problems, and potential solutions. What are the passwords for the services I Can't Open up a Terminal Window with VNC or Guacamole A SQL Statement failed but there are no error messages Apache Superset isn't Starting Apache Superset screens differ from the lab Too many incorrect logins using VNC and now I'm blocked Presto doesn't appear to be working Displaying Db2 Schema is failing Queries are failing with a 400 code Queries are failing with a 200 or 500 code Queries are failing with memory errors SSH, VNC and watsonx.data UI are not working No access to Presto/Minio UI after restart Firefox and Chrome freeze when connecting to MinIO What are the passwords for the services? See the section on Passwords . You can get all passwords for the system when you are logged in as the watsonx user by using the following command. cat /certs/passwords You can also use the Jupyter notebook link to display the userids and passwords for the services. I Can't Open up a Terminal Window with VNC or Guacamole First thing to remember is that you can't use VNC and the TechZone VM Remote Console (Guacamole) interface at the same time. Only one can be active at a time. If you can't use terminal windows in VNC If you find that the terminal icons \"spins\" inside the VNC window, this is caused by attempting to connect to the virtual machine by using the VM Remote Console button in your reservation details screen. To fix this problem, you must log out of the VNC session (top right corner of the Linux desktop - press the power button and choose logout). Once VNC logs back in you will be able use the terminal window. A SQL Statement failed, but there are no error messages You need to use the Presto console and search for the SQL statement. Click on the Query ID to find more details of the statement execution and scroll to the bottom of the web page to see any error details. Apache Superset isn't Starting If Superset doesn't start for some reason, you will need to reset it completely to try it again. First make sure you are connected as the watsonx user not root . Make sure you have stopped the terminal session that is running Apache Superset. Next remove the Apache Superset directory. sudo rm -rf /home/watsonx/superset We remove the docker images associated with Apache Superset. If no containers or volumes exist you will get an error message. docker ps -a -q --filter \"name=superset\" | xargs docker container rm --force docker volume list -q --filter \"name=superset\" | xargs docker volume rm --force Download the superset code again. git clone https://github.com/apache/superset.git The docker-compose-non-dev.yml file needs to be updated so that Apache Superset can access the same network that watsonx.data is using. cd ./superset cp docker-compose-non-dev.yml docker-compose-non-dev-backup.yml sed '/version: \"3.7\"/q' docker-compose-non-dev.yml > yamlfix.txt cat <<EOF >> yamlfix.txt networks: default: external: True name: ibm-lh-network EOF sed -e '1,/version: \"3.7\"/ d' docker-compose-non-dev.yml >> yamlfix.txt We update the Apache Superset code to version 2.1.0 . sed 's/\\${TAG:-latest-dev}/2.1.0/' yamlfix.txt > docker-compose-non-dev.yml Use docker-compose to start Apache Superset. nohup docker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up & The nohup command will issue a message indicating that output will be directed to the nohup.out file. It takes some time for the service to start, so be patient! You can view any output from the Apache Superset system by viewing the nohup.out file in the directory where you installed superset. Apache Superset screens differ from the lab The Apache Superset project makes frequent changes to the types of charts that are available. In some cases they remove or merge charts. Since these charts changes are dynamic, we are not able to guarantee that our examples will look the same as what you might have on your system. Presto doesn't appear to be working If you find that the watsonx.data UI is generating error messages that suggest that queries are not running, or that the Presto service is dead, you can force a soft restart of Presto with the following command: docker restart ibm-lh-presto This will restart the Presto server. If you find that does not fix your problem, you will need to do a hard reset using the following commands: sudo su - cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin ./stop_service ibm-lh-presto ./start_service ibm-lh-presto check_presto The command will wait until the service is running before exiting. Displaying Db2 Schema is failing Occasionally when attempting to expand the Db2 catalog (schema), the watsonx.data UI will not display any data or issue an error message. You can try refreshing the browser (not the refresh icon inside the UI) and try again. If you find that this is failing again, open the Query workspace and run the following SQL (replace db2_gosales with the name you cataloged the database with). select count(*) from db2_gosales.gosalesdw.go_org_dim The result should be 123 and hopefully the tables that are part of the schema will display for you. Queries are failing with a 400 code The watsonx.data UI will log you out after a period of inactivity, but doesn't tell you that this has happened. When you attempt to run a query, the error that is returned (400) indicates that you need to log back in again. Queries are failing with a 200 or 500 code A 500 code may indicate the watsonx.data UI has a problem connecting with the Presto engine. First log out of the console and trying logging back on. If that fails to solve the problem, you will need to reboot the console. Open up a terminal window into the server: As the root user, restart the docker container that is running the watsonx.data UI. docker restart lhconsole-nodeclient-svc Queries fail become of insufficient memory If you are running a complex query, you may get an error message similar to \"Query exceeded per-node user memory limit\" or a something similar. Watsonx.data (Presto) attempts to limit the amount of resources being using in a query and will stop a query if it exceeds a certain threshold. You can change the behavior of the system by making the following changes. Note : During this step you will disconnect anyone running a query on the server. What you need to do is make a change to the configuration settings of the Presto engine. AS the root user, enter the docker container for the presto engine: docker exec -it ibm-lh-presto /bin/bash Next, copy the original config file to a safe place in case we make an error: cp /opt/presto/etc/config.properties /opt/presto/etc/config.properties.backup Then update the properties file. cat >> /opt/presto/etc/config.properties << EOL experimental.spiller-spill-path=/tmp experimental.spiller-max-used-space-threshold=0.7 experimental.max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.query-max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.spill-enabled=true query.max-memory=10GB query.max-memory-per-node=10GB query.max-total-memory-per-node=10GB query.max-total-memory=10GB EOL Doublecheck that it worked. cat /opt/presto/etc/config.properties | grep experimental experimental.max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.query-max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.spill-enabled=true experimental.spiller-max-used-space-threshold=0.7 experimental.spiller-spill-path=/tmp If it is all good then exit the container. exit And now we restart the container. Make sure that you don't impact other users! docker restart ibm-lh-presto Now try running your query again. Note : Once you make this change, only restart presto using the above command, otherwise you will lose the changes. Too many incorrect logins using VNC and now I'm blocked from connecting If you lock yourself out of VNC because of too many incorrect logins, you can reset the service with the following commands. Connect as the root user then run the following command and you should be able to log in again. systemctl restart vncserver@:1 exit SSH, VNC and watsonx.data UI are not working Symptoms: You've tried to use SSH to log into the system, and you get a timeout error. All the Web-based UIs (watsonx.data UI, Presto) fail. Find your email message that contains details of your reservation. Details of what the reservations and the page containing details of the reservation can be found in the Accessing the reservation section. Once the details appear, scroll down to the bottom of the web page, and you will see the VM Remote Console button. You can access the logon screen of the virtual machine by pressing the VM Remote Console button. Clicking on this button will display the logon screen for the server. If you see this screen, the system is running and there is something wrong the watsonx.data service (see instructions below). If you see the following screen: This means your server has been turned off. Click on the Power on button. Make sure to press the Yes button to turn the power on! In a few minutes you should see the logon screen again. Wait for a few minutes for all the services to start, and then you will be able to use SSH, VNC, and watsonx.data UI. Reset watsonx.data If you can log into the watsonx userid using the VM Remove console, you can reset the watsonx.data server with the following steps. SSH into the server as the root user. Then switch to the development code bin directory. cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin Check the status of the system with the following command. ./status.sh --all Output will look similar to: using /root/ibm-lh-dev/localstorage/volumes as data root directory for user: root/1001 infra config location is /root/ibm-lh-dev/localstorage/volumes/infra lhconsole-ui running 0.0.0.0:9443->8443/tcp, :::9443->8443/tcp lhconsole-nodeclient-svc running 3001/tcp lhconsole-javaapi-svc running 8090/tcp lhconsole-api running 3333/tcp, 8081/tcp ibm-lh-presto running 0.0.0.0:8443->8443/tcp, :::8443->8443/tcp ibm-lh-hive-metastore running ibm-lh-postgres running 5432/tcp ibm-lh-minio running If the any of the services are not running, you will need to restart the system with the following set of commands. cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin ./stop.sh export LH_RUN_MODE=diag ./start.sh Wait for all services to start and then check to see if you can connect to the watsonx.data UI. No access to Presto/Minio UI after restart If you are using a TechZone image that has been suspended, or restarted, you may come across a situation where you are unable to connect to any service that uses the http protocol. The watsonx.service needs to have a diagnostic flag set that opens up these ports, and sometimes this diagnostic setting is not being updated. To manually stop and start the system, you will need to connect with root user privileges and run the following commands: sudo su - cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin ./stop.sh export LH_RUN_MODE=diag ./start.sh This set of commands will stop all the services in watsonx.data and restart them in diagnostic mode. This will now open the http ports for use. Firefox and Chrome freeze when connecting to MinIO Firefox and Chrome on OSX will occasionally freeze when connecting to the MinIO console. The Safari browser is much more reliable. This problem appears to be caused by some features which are not properly handled by these browsers.","title":"Troubleshooting watsonx.data"},{"location":"wxd-troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-watsonxdata","text":"Although we have tried to make the lab as error-free as possible, occasionally things will go wrong.

Download the watsonxdata.ova file onto your local machine and then use the import function of VMware or VirtualBox to register it with the system. Note : This virtual machine was created using X64 (Intel) hardware, so this will not work in an OSX environment using M1/M2 chips. Once the machine is imported you can delete the OVA file.

The following URLs and Ports are used to access the watsonx.data services. The ports that are used in the lab are listed below. https://localhost:9443 - watsonx.data management console http://localhost:8080 - Presto console http://localhost:9001 - MinIO console (S3 buckets) https://localhost:6443 - Portainer (Docker container management) http://localhost:8088 - Apache Superset (Query and Graphing) 8443 - Presto External Port 5432 - Postgres External Port 50000 - Db2 Database Port The Apache Superset link will not be active until started as part of the lab.

Next, check that your network connection is up and running. You will be able to see if the network is connected when the network icon appears on the top row. If it shows Wired Off, make sure to turn it on by clicking on the arrow and choosing \u201cConnect\u201d. If you are using something other than an English keyboard, click on the en1 symbol on the top bar to switch to a different layout. If your keyboard is not listed, you will need to go into Settings and add your keyboard layout. You may also want to consider making the screen size larger. Use the drop-down menu at the top of the screen to select System Tools -> Settings. In the Devices section of the Setting menu, select Displays and choose a resolution that is suitable for your environment. Using External Ports with VMware/Virtual Box The labs assume that you are using a browser \"within\" your virtual machine console. However, both VMware and VirtualBox provide a method for accessing the ports on the virtual machine in your local environment. VMware For VMware, the easiest way to connect to the virtual machine from your host machine is to use the ifconfig command to determine your virtual machine IP address. ifconfig Search for an ensxx** value in the output from the command. There you should see the inet address of your virtual machine ( 172.16.210.237 ). To access the Portainer application from your local browser, you would use this address followed by the Portainer PORT number: https://172.16.210.237:6443 . Remember that inside your virtual machine, you will be using https://localhost:6443 . The following PORT numbers are open in the machine: 9443 - IBM watsonx.data management console 8080 - Presto console 9001 - MinIO console (S3 buckets) 6443 - Portainer (Docker container management) 8088 - Apache Superset (Query and Graphing) 5901 - VNC Access (Access to GUI in the machine) 7681 - SSH (Terminal access) via Browser 22 - SSH (Terminal access) via local terminal program 8443 - Presto External Port (dBeaver connection) 5432 - Postgres External Port (dBeaver connection) VirtualBox VirtualBox does not externalize the IP address of the virtual machine. The ifconfig command will provide an IP address of the machine, but it will not be reachable from your host browser. To open the ports, you must use the network option on the virtual machine. This step can be done while the machine is running. From the VirtualBox console, choose Settings for the machine and then click on the Network option. Press the Advanced option near the bottom of the dialog. Select the Port Forwarding button. This will display the port forwarding menu. You must place an entry for each port that we want to externalize to the host machine. If the value for Host IP is empty (blank), it defaults to localhost. In the example above, the 5901 port in the Guest machine (watsonxdata) is mapped to the host machines 5901 port. To access VNC, you would use localhost:5901 . If the guest machine port conflicts with the host machine port number, you can use a different port number. Terminal Command Window All the commands in the lab will require you execute commands in a terminal window. In addition, the labs require access to the root userid, and this can be accomplished in two ways that are described below. Local Terminal Shell Use a local terminal shell (iterm, Hyper, terminal) and use the SSH command to shell into the machine. For the VMware image, you need to know the IP address of the image and the port number that has been exposed for SSH command (default is 22). Assuming that your VMware machine has an IP address of 172.16.210.237 , the command to SSH into the machine would be: ssh watsonx@172.16.210.237 You will need to accept the unknown host warning and then provide the password for the watsonx userid: watsonx.data . At this point you are connected as the watsonx user. To become the root user, you must enter the following command in the terminal window. sudo su - Now as the root user you will be ready to run the commands found in the lab. Terminal Window in Virtual Machine You can use the Terminal application in the virtual machine to issue commands. This will open up the terminal window. At this point you are connected as the watsonx user. You can ignore any lab instructions that ask you to ssh into the watsonx server. To become the root user, you must enter the following command in the terminal window. sudo su - Now as the root user you will be ready to run the commands found in the lab.","title":"IBM watsonx.data VMware Image"},{"location":"wxd-vmware/#ibm-watsonxdata-vmware-image","text":"The IBM watsonx.data lab can be run in a virtual machine environment using VMWare Workstation, VMWare Fusion, or Oracle VirtualBox.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below. Note that in general Flot gives no guarantees if you change any of the objects you pass in to the plot function or get out of it since they're not necessarily deep-copied. Data Format The data is an array of data series: [ series1 , series2 , ... ] A series can either be raw data or an object with properties. The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ] Plot Options All options are completely optional. They are documented individually below, to change them you just specify them in an object, e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true }, points : { show : true } } }; $ . plot ( placeholder , data , options ); Customizing the legend legend : { show : boolean labelFormatter : null or ( fn : string , series object -> string ) labelBoxBorderColor : color noColumns : number position : \"ne\" or \"nw\" or \"se\" or \"sw\" margin : number of pixels or [ x margin , y margin ] backgroundColor : null or color backgroundOpacity : number between 0 and 1 container : null or jQuery object / DOM element / jQuery expression sorted : null / false , true , \"ascending\" , \"descending\" , \"reverse\" , or a comparator } The legend is generated as a table with the data series labels and small label boxes with the color of the series. If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) } Customizing the axes xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places. Multiple axes If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\". Time series data Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between. Customizing the data series series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme. Customizing the grid grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device). The default is capped to 60 frames per second. You can set it to -1 to disable the rate limiting. Specifying gradients A gradient is specified like this: { colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] } For instance, you might specify a background on the grid going from black to gray like this: grid : { backgroundColor : { colors : [ \"#000\" , \"#999\" ] } } For the series you can specify the gradient as an object that specifies the scaling of the brightness and the opacity of the series color, e.g. { colors : [{ opacity : 0.8 }, { brightness : 0.6 , opacity : 0.8 } ] } where the first color simply has its alpha scaled, whereas the second is also darkened. For instance, for bars the following makes the bars gradually disappear, without outline: bars : { show : true , lineWidth : 0 , fill : true , fillColor : { colors : [ { opacity : 0.8 }, { opacity : 0.1 } ] } } Flot currently only supports vertical gradients drawn from top to bottom because that's what works with IE. Plot Methods The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you can call: highlight(series, datapoint) Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change. Hooks In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info. Plugins Plugins extend the functionality of Flot. To use a plugin, simply include its Javascript file after Flot in the HTML page. If you're worried about download size/latency, you can concatenate all the plugins you use, and Flot itself for that matter, into one big file (make sure you get the order right), then optionally run it through a Javascript minifier such as YUI Compressor. Here's a brief explanation of how the plugin plumbings work: Each plugin registers itself in the global array $.plot.plugins. When you make a new plot object with $.plot, Flot goes through this array calling the \"init\" function of each plugin and merging default options from the \"option\" attribute of the plugin. The init function gets a reference to the plot object created and uses this to register hooks and add new public methods if needed. See the PLUGINS document for details on how to write a plugin. As the above description hints, it's actually pretty easy.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below.

The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ]","title":"Data Format"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plot-options","text":"All options are completely optional.

If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) }","title":"Customizing the legend"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-axes","text":"xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places.","title":"Customizing the axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#multiple-axes","text":"If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\".","title":"Multiple axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#time-series-data","text":"Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between.","title":"Time series data"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-data-series","text":"series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme.","title":"Customizing the data series"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-grid","text":"grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device). The default is capped to 60 frames per second. You can set it to -1 to disable the rate limiting.","title":"Customizing the grid"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#specifying-gradients","text":"A gradient is specified like this: { colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] } For instance, you might specify a background on the grid going from black to gray like this: grid : { backgroundColor : { colors : [ \"#000\" , \"#999\" ] } } For the series you can specify the gradient as an object that specifies the scaling of the brightness and the opacity of the series color, e.g. { colors : [{ opacity : 0.8 }, { brightness : 0.6 , opacity : 0.8 } ] } where the first color simply has its alpha scaled, whereas the second is also darkened. For instance, for bars the following makes the bars gradually disappear, without outline: bars : { show : true , lineWidth : 0 , fill : true , fillColor : { colors : [ { opacity : 0.8 }, { opacity : 0.1 } ] } } Flot currently only supports vertical gradients drawn from top to bottom because that's what works with IE.","title":"Specifying gradients"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plot-methods","text":"The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you can call: highlight(series, datapoint) Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change.","title":"Plot Methods"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#hooks","text":"In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info.","title":"Hooks"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plugins","text":"Plugins extend the functionality of Flot.

Flot will happily draw everything you send to it so the answer depends on the browser. The excanvas emulation used for IE (built with VML) makes IE by far the slowest browser so be sure to test with that if IE users are in your target group (for large plots in IE, you can also check out Flashcanvas which may be faster). 1000 points is not a problem, but as soon as you start having more points than the pixel width, you should probably start thinking about downsampling/aggregation as this is near the resolution limit of the chart anyway. If you downsample server-side, you also save bandwidth. Flot isn't working when I'm using JSON data as source! Actually, Flot loves JSON data, you just got the format wrong. Double check that you're not inputting strings instead of numbers, like [[\"0\", \"-2.13\"], [\"5\", \"4.3\"]]. This is most common mistake, and the error might not show up immediately because Javascript can do some conversion automatically. Can I export the graph? You can grab the image rendered by the canvas element used by Flot as a PNG or JPEG (remember to set a background). Note that it won't include anything not drawn in the canvas (such as the legend). And it doesn't work with excanvas which uses VML, but you could try Flashcanvas. The bars are all tiny in time mode? It's not really possible to determine the bar width automatically. So you have to set the width with the barWidth option which is NOT in pixels, but in the units of the x axis (or the y axis for horizontal bars). For time mode that's milliseconds so the default value of 1 makes the bars 1 millisecond wide. Can I use Flot with libraries like Mootools or Prototype? Yes, Flot supports it out of the box and it's easy! Just use jQuery instead of $, e.g. call jQuery.plot instead of $.plot and use jQuery(something) instead of $(something). As a convenience, you can put in a DOM element for the graph placeholder where the examples and the API documentation are using jQuery objects. Depending on how you include jQuery, you may have to add one line of code to prevent jQuery from overwriting functions from the other libraries, see the documentation in jQuery (\"Using jQuery with other libraries\") for details. Flot doesn't work with [insert name of Javascript UI framework]! Flot is using standard HTML to make charts. If this is not working, it's probably because the framework you're using is doing something weird with the DOM or with the CSS that is interfering with Flot. A common problem is that there's display:none on a container until the user does something. Many tab widgets work this way, and there's nothing wrong with it - you just can't call Flot inside a display:none container as explained in the README so you need to hold off the Flot call until the container is actually displayed (or use visibility:hidden instead of display:none or move the container off-screen).

(patch by soenter, pull request #1221) Bug fixes Added a work-around to disable the allocation of extra space for first and last axis ticks, allowing plots to span the full width of their container. A proper solution for this bug will be implemented in the 0.9 release. (reported by Josh Pigford and andig, issue #1212, pull request #1290) Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.1, where the last tick label would sometimes wrap rather than extending the plot's offset to create space. (reported by Elite Gamer, issue #1283) Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.2, where the resize plugin would use unexpectedly high amounts of CPU even when idle. (reported by tommie, issue #1277, pull request #1289) Fixed the selection example to work with jQuery 1.9.x and later. (reported by EGLadona and dmfalke, issue #1250, pull request #1285) Added a detach shim to fix support for jQuery versions earlier than 1.4.x. (reported by ngavard, issue #1240, pull request #1286) Fixed a rare 'Uncaught TypeError' when using the resize plugin in IE 7/8. (reported by tleish, issue #1265, pull request #1289) Fixed zoom constraints to apply only in the direction of the zoom. (patch by Neil Katin, issue #1204, pull request #1205) Markings lines are no longer blurry when drawn on pixel boundaries. (reported by btccointicker and Rouillard, issue #1210) Don't discard original pie data-series values when combining slices. (patch by Phil Tsarik, pull request #1238) Fixed broken auto-scale behavior when using deprecated [x|y]2axis options. (reported by jorese, issue #1228, pull request #1284) Exposed the dateGenerator function on the plot object, as it used to be before time-mode was moved into a separate plugin. (patch by Paolo Valleri, pull request #1028) Flot 0.8.2 Changes Added a plot.destroy method as a way to free memory when emptying the plot placeholder and then re-using it for some other purpose. (patch by Thodoris Greasidis, issue #1129, pull request #1130) Added a table of contents and PLUGINS link to the API documentation. (patches by Brian Peiris, pull requests #1064 and #1127) Added Ruby code examples for time conversion. (patch by Mike Po\u0142tyn, pull request #1182) Minor improvements to API.md and README.md. (patches by Patrik Ragnarsson, pull requests #1085 and #1086) Updated inlined jQuery Resize to the latest version to fix errors. (reported by Matthew Sabol and sloker, issues #997 ad #1081) Bug fixes Fixed an unexpected change in behavior that resulted in duplicate tick labels when using a plugin, like flot-tickrotor, that overrode tick labels. (patch by Mark Cote, pull request #1091) Fixed a regression from 0.7 where axis labels were given the wrong width, causing them to overlap at certain scales and ignore the labelWidth option. (patch by Benjamin Gram, pull request #1177) Fixed a bug where the second axis in an xaxes/yaxes array incorrectly had its 'innermost' property set to false or undefined, even if it was on the other side of the plot from the first axis. This resulted in the axis bar being visible when it shouldn't have been, which was especially obvious when the grid had a left/right border width of zero.

(reported by ryleyb, issue #1056) When removing series labels and redrawing the plot, the legend now updates correctly even when using an external container. (patch by Luis Silva, issue #1159, pull request #1160) The pie plugin no longer ignores the value of the left offset option. (reported by melanker, issue #1136) Fixed a regression from 0.7, where extra padding was added unnecessarily to sides of the plot where there was no last tick label.

(patch by Anthony Ryan, pull request #1180) Worked around a browser issue that caused bars to appear un-filled. (reported by irbian, issue #915) Flot 0.8.1 Bug fixes Fixed a regression in the time plugin, introduced in 0.8, that caused dates to align to the minute rather than to the highest appropriate unit. This caused many x-axes in 0.8 to have different ticks than they did in 0.7. (reported by Tom Sheppard, patch by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1017, pull request #1023) Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, that caused axis labels with the same text as another label on the same axis to disappear. More generally, it's again possible to have the same text in two locations. (issue #1032) Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, where axis labels were no longer assigned an explicit width, and their text could not wrap. (reported by sabregreen, issue #1019) Fixed a regression in the pie plugin, introduced in 0.8, that prevented it from accepting data in the format '[[x, y]]'. (patch by Nicolas Morel, pull request #1024) The 'zero' series option and 'autoscale' format option are no longer ignored when the series contains a null value. (reported by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1033) Avoid triggering the time-mode plugin exception when there are zero series. (reported by Daniel Rothig, patch by Mark Raymond, issue #1016) When a custom color palette has fewer colors than the default palette, Flot no longer fills out the colors with the remainder of the default. (patch by goorpy, issue #1031, pull request #1034) Fixed missing update for bar highlights after a zoom or other redraw. (reported by Paolo Valleri, issue #1030) Fixed compatibility with jQuery versions earlier than 1.7. (patch by Lee Willis, issue #1027, pull request #1027) The mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page when using the navigate plugin. (patch by vird, pull request #1020) Fixed missing semicolons in the core library. (reported by Michal Zglinski) Flot 0.8.0 API changes Support for time series has been moved into a plugin, jquery.flot.time.js. This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540). Changes Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting. (patch by risicle, issue 49) Date/time formatting follows proper subset of strftime specifiers, and support added for Date.prototype.strftime, if found. (patch by Mark Cote, issues 419 and 558) Fixed display of year ticks. (patch by Mark Cote, issue 195) Support for time series moved to plugin. (patch by Mark Cote) Display time series in different time zones. (patch by Knut Forkalsrud, issue 141) Added a canvas plugin to enable rendering axis tick labels to the canvas.

(suggested in issue 185) Support for multiple thresholds in thresholds plugin. (patch by Arnaud Bellec, issue 523) Support for plotting categories/textual data directly with new categories plugin. Tick generators now get the whole axis rather than just min/max. Added processOffset and drawBackground hooks. (suggested in issue 639) Added a grid \"margin\" option to set the space between the canvas edge and the grid. Prevent the pie example page from generating single-slice pies. (patch by Shane Reustle) In addition to \"left\" and \"center\", bars now recognize \"right\" as an alignment option. (patch by Michael Mayer, issue 520) Switched from toFixed to a much faster default tickFormatter. (patch by Clemens Stolle) Added to a more helpful error when using a time-mode axis without including the flot.time plugin. (patch by Yael Elmatad) Added a legend \"sorted\" option to control sorting of legend entries independent of their series order. (patch by Tom Cleaveland) Added a series \"highlightColor\" option to control the color of the translucent overlay that identifies the dataset when the mouse hovers over it. (patch by Eric Wendelin and Nate Abele, issues 168 and 299) Added a plugin jquery.flot.errorbars, with an accompanying example, that adds the ability to plot error bars, commonly used in many kinds of statistical data visualizations. (patch by Rui Pereira, issue 215) The legend now omits entries whose labelFormatter returns null. (patch by Tom Cleaveland, Christopher Lambert, and Simon Strandgaard) Added support for high pixel density (retina) displays, resulting in much crisper charts on such devices. (patch by Olivier Guerriat, additional fixes by Julien Thomas, maimairel, and Lau Bech Lauritzen) Added the ability to control pie shadow position and alpha via a new pie 'shadow' option. (patch by Julien Thomas, pull request #78) Added the ability to set width and color for individual sides of the grid. (patch by Ara Anjargolian, additional fixes by Karl Swedberg, pull requests #855 and #880) The selection plugin's getSelection now returns null when the selection has been cleared. (patch by Nick Campbell, pull request #852) Added a new option called 'zero' to bars and filled lines series, to control whether the y-axis minimum is scaled to fit the data or set to zero. (patch by David Schnur, issues #316, #529, and #856, pull request #911) The plot function is now also a jQuery chainable property. (patch by David Schnur, issues #734 and #816, pull request #953) When only a single pie slice is beneath the combine threshold it is no longer replaced by an 'other' slice. (suggested by Devin Bayer, issue #638) Added lineJoin and minSize options to the selection plugin to control the corner style and minimum size of the selection, respectively.

(reported by Paolo Valleri, issue #964) Fixed inconsistencies between the highlight and unhighlight functions. (reported by djamshed, issue #987) Fixed recalculation of tickSize and tickDecimals on calls to setupGrid. (patch by thecountofzero, pull request #861, issues #860, #1000) Flot 0.7 API changes Multiple axes support. Code using dual axes should be changed from using x2axis/y2axis in the options to using an array (although backwards- compatibility hooks are in place). For instance, { xaxis : { ... }, x2axis : { ... }, yaxis : { ... }, y2axis : { ... } } becomes { xaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ], yaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ] } Note that if you're just using one axis, continue to use the xaxis/yaxis directly (it now sets the default settings for the arrays). Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra axes into account, check the source to see some examples. A related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected. So if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in the chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly. \"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a corresponding option on the axes, so: { grid : { tickColor : \"#000\" }} becomes { xaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" }, yaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" } } But if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a tick color by adding transparency. Backwards-compatibility hooks are in place. Final note: now that IE 9 is coming out with canvas support, you may want to adapt the excanvas include to skip loading it in IE 9 (the examples have been adapted thanks to Ryley Breiddal). An alternative to excanvas using Flash has also surfaced, if your graphs are slow in IE, you may want to give it a spin: http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/ Changes Support for specifying a bottom for each point for line charts when filling them, this means that an arbitrary bottom can be used instead of just the x axis. (based on patches patiently provided by Roman V. Prikhodchenko) New fillbetween plugin that can compute a bottom for a series from another series, useful for filling areas between lines. See new example percentiles.html for a use case. More predictable handling of gaps for the stacking plugin, now all undefined ranges are skipped. Stacking plugin can stack horizontal bar charts. Navigate plugin now redraws the plot while panning instead of only after the fact. (raised by lastthemy, issue 235) Can be disabled by setting the pan.frameRate option to null. Date formatter now accepts %0m and %0d to get a zero-padded month or day. (issue raised by Maximillian Dornseif) Revamped internals to support an unlimited number of axes, not just dual. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) New setting on axes, \"tickLength\", to control the size of ticks or turn them off without turning off the labels. Axis labels are now put in container divs with classes, for instance labels in the x axes can be reached via \".xAxis .tickLabel\". Support for setting the color of an axis. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Tick color is now auto-generated as the base color with some transparency, unless you override it. Support for aligning ticks in the axes with \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to ensure that they appear next to each other rather than in between, at the expense of possibly awkward tick steps. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Support for customizing the point type through a callback when plotting points and new symbol plugin with some predefined point types. (sponsored by Utility Data Corporation) Resize plugin for automatically redrawing when the placeholder changes size, e.g. on window resizes. (sponsored by Novus Partners) A resize() method has been added to plot object facilitate this. Support Infinity/-Infinity for plotting asymptotes by hacking it into +/-Number.MAX_VALUE. (reported by rabaea.mircea) Support for restricting navigate plugin to not pan/zoom an axis. (based on patch by kkaefer) Support for providing the drag cursor for the navigate plugin as an option. (based on patch by Kelly T. Moore) Options for controlling whether an axis is shown or not (suggestion by Timo Tuominen) and whether to reserve space for it even if it isn't shown. New attribute $.plot.version with the Flot version as a string. The version comment is now included in the minified jquery.flot.min.js. New options.grid.minBorderMargin for adjusting the minimum margin provided around the border (based on patch by corani, issue 188). Refactor replot behaviour so Flot tries to reuse the existing canvas, adding shutdown() methods to the plot. (based on patch by Ryley Breiddal, issue 269) This prevents a memory leak in Chrome and hopefully makes replotting faster for those who are using $.plot instead of .setData()/.draw(). Also update jQuery to 1.5.1 to prevent IE leaks fixed in jQuery. New real-time line chart example. New hooks: drawSeries, shutdown. Bug fixes Fixed problem with findNearbyItem and bars on top of each other. (reported by ragingchikn, issue 242) Fixed problem with ticks and the border. (based on patch from ultimatehustler69, issue 236) Fixed problem with plugins adding options to the series objects. Fixed a problem introduced in 0.6 with specifying a gradient with: {brightness: x, opacity: y } Don't use $.browser.msie, check for getContext on the created canvas element instead and try to use excanvas if it's not found. Fixes IE 9 compatibility. highlight(s, index) was looking up the point in the original s.data instead of in the computed datapoints array, which breaks with plugins that modify the datapoints, such as the stacking plugin. (reported by curlypaul924, issue 316) More robust handling of axis from data passed in from getData(). (reported) by Morgan) Fixed problem with turning off bar outline. (fix by Jordi Castells, issue 253) Check the selection passed into setSelection in the selection plugin, to guard against errors when synchronizing plots (fix by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Fix bug in crosshair code with mouseout resetting the crosshair even if it is locked (fix by Lau Bech Lauritzen and Banko Adam). Fix bug with points plotting using line width from lines rather than points. Fix bug with passing non-array 0 data (for plugins that don't expect arrays, patch by vpapp1). Fix errors in JSON in examples so they work with jQuery 1.4.2 (fix reported by honestbleeps, issue 357). Fix bug with tooltip in interacting.html, this makes the tooltip much smoother (fix by bdkahn). Fix related bug inside highlighting handler in Flot. Use closure trick to make inline colorhelpers plugin respect jQuery.noConflict(true), renaming the global jQuery object (reported by Nick Stielau). Listen for mouseleave events and fire a plothover event with empty item when it occurs to drop highlights when the mouse leaves the plot (reported by by outspirit). Fix bug with using aboveData with a background (reported by amitayd). Fix possible excanvas leak (report and suggested fix by tom9729). Fix bug with backwards compatibility for shadowSize = 0 (report and suggested fix by aspinak). Adapt examples to skip loading excanvas (fix by Ryley Breiddal). Fix bug that prevent a simple f(x) = -x transform from working correctly (fix by Mike, issue 263). Fix bug in restoring cursor in navigate plugin (reported by Matteo Gattanini, issue 395). Fix bug in picking items when transform/inverseTransform is in use (reported by Ofri Raviv, and patches and analysis by Jan and Tom Paton, issue 334 and 467). Fix problem with unaligned ticks and hover/click events caused by padding on the placeholder by hardcoding the placeholder padding to 0 (reported by adityadineshsaxena, Matt Sommer, Daniel Atos and some other people, issue 301). Update colorhelpers plugin to avoid dying when trying to parse an invalid string (reported by cadavor, issue 483). Flot 0.6 API changes Selection support has been moved to a plugin. Thus if you're passing selection: { mode: something }, you MUST include the file jquery.flot.selection.js after jquery.flot.js. This reduces the size of base Flot and makes it easier to customize the selection as well as improving code clarity. The change is based on a patch from andershol. In the global options specified in the $.plot command, \"lines\", \"points\", \"bars\" and \"shadowSize\" have been moved to a sub-object called \"series\": $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { lines : { show : true }}) should be changed to $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { series : { lines : { show : true }}}) All future series-specific options will go into this sub-object to simplify plugin writing. Backward-compatibility code is in place, so old code should not break. \"plothover\" no longer provides the original data point, but instead a normalized one, since there may be no corresponding original point. Due to a bug in previous versions of jQuery, you now need at least jQuery 1.2.6. But if you can, try jQuery 1.3.2 as it got some improvements in event handling speed. Changes Added support for disabling interactivity for specific data series. (request from Ronald Schouten and Steve Upton) Flot now calls $() on the placeholder and optional legend container passed in so you can specify DOM elements or CSS expressions to make it easier to use Flot with libraries like Prototype or Mootools or through raw JSON from Ajax responses. A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making a selection. The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most 10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if you're doing something really expensive on this event. The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even replaced. Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid. (patches from Amaury Chamayou and Mike R. Williamson) Added support for gradient backgrounds for the grid. (based on patch from Amaury Chamayou, issue 90) The \"setting options\" example provides a demonstration. Gradient bars. (suggestion by stefpet) Added a \"plotunselected\" event which is triggered when the selection is removed, see \"selection\" example. (suggestion by Meda Ugo) The option legend.margin can now specify horizontal and vertical margins independently. (suggestion by someone who's annoyed) Data passed into Flot is now copied to a new canonical format to enable further processing before it hits the drawing routines. As a side-effect, this should make Flot more robust in the face of bad data. (issue 112) Step-wise charting: line charts have a new option \"steps\" that when set to true connects the points with horizontal/vertical steps instead of diagonal lines. The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just the label. (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier) Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun). Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked bars. New option to disable the (grid.show). Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an offset within the placeholder. Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to internal state. Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some hooks are defined, more are likely to come. Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines. Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use). Image plugin: plot prerendered images. Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot. More configurable grid. Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends). Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge). The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin. It's included inline in the Flot source to make dependency managing easier. This also makes it really easy to use the color helpers in Flot plugins. Bug fixes Fixed two corner-case bugs when drawing filled curves. (report and analysis by Joshua Varner) Fix auto-adjustment code when setting min to 0 for an axis where the dataset is completely flat on that axis. (report by chovy) Fixed a bug with passing in data from getData to setData when the secondary axes are used. (reported by nperelman, issue 65) Fixed so that it is possible to turn lines off when no other chart type is shown (based on problem reported by Glenn Vanderburg), and fixed so that setting lineWidth to 0 also hides the shadow. (based on problem reported by Sergio Nunes) Updated mousemove position expression to the latest from jQuery. (reported by meyuchas) Use CSS borders instead of background in legend. (issues 25 and 45) Explicitly convert axis min/max to numbers. Fixed a bug with drawing marking lines with different colors. (reported by Khurram) Fixed a bug with returning y2 values in the selection event. (fix by exists, issue 75) Only set position relative on placeholder if it hasn't already a position different from static. (reported by kyberneticist, issue 95) Don't round markings to prevent sub-pixel problems. (reported by Dan Lipsitt) Make the grid border act similarly to a regular CSS border, i.e. prevent it from overlapping the plot itself. This also fixes a problem with anti- aliasing when the width is 1 pixel. (reported by Anthony Ettinger) Imported version 3 of excanvas and fixed two issues with the newer version. Hopefully, this will make Flot work with IE8. (nudge by Fabien Menager, further analysis by Booink, issue 133) Changed the shadow code for lines to hopefully look a bit better with vertical lines. Round tick positions to avoid possible problems with fractions. (suggestion by Fred, issue 130) Made the heuristic for determining how many ticks to aim for a bit smarter. Fix for uneven axis margins (report and patch by Paul Kienzle) and snapping to ticks. (report and patch by lifthrasiir) Fixed bug with slicing in findNearbyItems. (patch by zollman) Make heuristic for x axis label widths more dynamic. (patch by rickinhethuis) Make sure points on top take precedence when finding nearby points when hovering. (reported by didroe, issue 224) Flot 0.5 Timestamps are now in UTC. Also \"selected\" event -> becomes \"plotselected\" with new data, the parameters for setSelection are now different (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place), coloredAreas becomes markings with a new interface (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place). API changes Timestamps in time mode are now displayed according to UTC instead of the time zone of the visitor. This affects the way the timestamps should be input; you'll probably have to offset the timestamps according to your local time zone. It also affects any custom date handling code (which basically now should use the equivalent UTC date mehods, e.g. .setUTCMonth() instead of .setMonth(). Markings, previously coloredAreas, are now specified as ranges on the axes, like { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }} . Furthermore with markings you can now draw horizontal/vertical lines by setting from and to to the same coordinate. (idea from line support patch by by Ryan Funduk) Interactivity: added a new \"plothover\" event and this and the \"plotclick\" event now returns the closest data item (based on patch by /david, patch by Mark Byers for bar support). See the revamped \"interacting with the data\" example for some hints on what you can do. Highlighting: you can now highlight points and datapoints are autohighlighted when you hover over them (if hovering is turned on). Support for dual axis has been added (based on patch by someone who's annoyed and /david). For each data series you can specify which axes it belongs to, and there are two more axes, x2axis and y2axis, to customize. This affects the \"selected\" event which has been renamed to \"plotselected\" and spews out { xaxis: { from: -10, to: 20 } ... }, setSelection in which the parameters are on a new form (backwards compatible hooks are in place so old code shouldn't break) and markings (formerly coloredAreas). Changes Added support for specifying the size of tick labels (axis.labelWidth, axis.labelHeight). Useful for specifying a max label size to keep multiple plots aligned. The \"fill\" option can now be a number that specifies the opacity of the fill. You can now specify a coordinate as null (like [2, null]) and Flot will take the other coordinate into account when scaling the axes. (based on patch by joebno) New option for bars \"align\". Set it to \"center\" to center the bars on the value they represent. setSelection now takes a second parameter which you can use to prevent the method from firing the \"plotselected\" handler. Improved the handling of axis auto-scaling with bars. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in calculating spacing around the plot. (reported by timothytoe) Fixed a bug in finding max values for all-negative data sets. Prevent the possibility of eternal looping in tick calculations. Fixed a bug when borderWidth is set to 0. (reported by Rob/sanchothefat) Fixed a bug with drawing bars extending below 0. (reported by James Hewitt, patch by Ryan Funduk). Fixed a bug with line widths of bars. (reported by MikeM) Fixed a bug with 'nw' and 'sw' legend positions. Fixed a bug with multi-line x-axis tick labels. (reported by Luca Ciano, IE-fix help by Savage Zhang) Using the \"container\" option in legend now overwrites the container element instead of just appending to it, fixing the infinite legend bug. (reported by several people, fix by Brad Dewey) Flot 0.4 API changes Deprecated axis.noTicks in favor of just specifying the number as axis.ticks. So xaxis: { noTicks: 10 } becomes xaxis: { ticks: 10 } . Time series support. Specify axis.mode: \"time\", put in Javascript timestamps as data, and Flot will automatically spit out sensible ticks. Take a look at the two new examples. The format can be customized with axis.timeformat and axis.monthNames, or if that fails with axis.tickFormatter. Support for colored background areas via grid.coloredAreas. Specify an array of { x1, y1, x2, y2 } objects or a function that returns these given { xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax }. More members on the plot object (report by Chris Davies and others). \"getData\" for inspecting the assigned settings on data series (e.g. color) and \"setData\", \"setupGrid\" and \"draw\" for updating the contents without a total replot. The default number of ticks to aim for is now dependent on the size of the plot in pixels. Support for customizing tick interval sizes directly with axis.minTickSize and axis.tickSize. Cleaned up the automatic axis scaling algorithm and fixed how it interacts with ticks. Also fixed a couple of tick-related corner case bugs (one reported by mainstreetmark, another reported by timothytoe). The option axis.tickFormatter now takes a function with two parameters, the second parameter is an optional object with information about the axis. It has min, max, tickDecimals, tickSize. Changes Added support for segmented lines. (based on patch from Michael MacDonald) Added support for ignoring null and bad values. (suggestion from Nick Konidaris and joshwaihi) Added support for changing the border width. (thanks to joebno and safoo) Label colors can be changed via CSS by selecting the tickLabel class. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in handling single-item bar series. (reported by Emil Filipov) Fixed erratic behaviour when interacting with the plot with IE 7. (reported by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Prevent IE/Safari text selection when selecting stuff on the canvas. Flot 0.3 This is mostly a quick-fix release because jquery.js wasn't included in the previous zip/tarball. Changes Include jquery.js in the zip/tarball. Support clicking on the plot. Turn it on with grid: { clickable: true }, then you get a \"plotclick\" event on the graph placeholder with the position in units of the plot. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in dealing with data where min = max. (thanks to Michael Messinides) Flot 0.2 The API should now be fully documented. API changes Moved labelMargin option to grid from x/yaxis. Changes Added support for putting a background behind the default legend. The default is the partly transparent background color. Added backgroundColor and backgroundOpacity to the legend options to control this. The ticks options can now be a callback function that takes one parameter, an object with the attributes min and max. The function should return a ticks array. Added labelFormatter option in legend, useful for turning the legend labels into links. Reduced the size of the code.

This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540).","title":"API changes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/NEWS/#changes_2","text":"Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting.

So if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in the chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly. \"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a corresponding option on the axes, so: { grid : { tickColor : \"#000\" }} becomes { xaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" }, yaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" } } But if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a tick color by adding transparency. Backwards-compatibility hooks are in place. Final note: now that IE 9 is coming out with canvas support, you may want to adapt the excanvas include to skip loading it in IE 9 (the examples have been adapted thanks to Ryley Breiddal). An alternative to excanvas using Flash has also surfaced, if your graphs are slow in IE, you may want to give it a spin: http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/","title":"API changes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t1-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/NEWS/#changes_3","text":"Support for specifying a bottom for each point for line charts when filling them, this means that an arbitrary bottom can be used instead of just the x axis.

Thus if you're passing selection: { mode: something }, you MUST include the file jquery.flot.selection.js after jquery.flot.js. This reduces the size of base Flot and makes it easier to customize the selection as well as improving code clarity. The change is based on a patch from andershol. In the global options specified in the $.plot command, \"lines\", \"points\", \"bars\" and \"shadowSize\" have been moved to a sub-object called \"series\": $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { lines : { show : true }}) should be changed to $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { series : { lines : { show : true }}}) All future series-specific options will go into this sub-object to simplify plugin writing. Backward-compatibility code is in place, so old code should not break. \"plothover\" no longer provides the original data point, but instead a normalized one, since there may be no corresponding original point.

A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making a selection. The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most 10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if you're doing something really expensive on this event. The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even replaced. Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid. (patches from Amaury Chamayou and Mike R. Williamson) Added support for gradient backgrounds for the grid. (based on patch from Amaury Chamayou, issue 90) The \"setting options\" example provides a demonstration. Gradient bars. (suggestion by stefpet) Added a \"plotunselected\" event which is triggered when the selection is removed, see \"selection\" example. (suggestion by Meda Ugo) The option legend.margin can now specify horizontal and vertical margins independently. (suggestion by someone who's annoyed) Data passed into Flot is now copied to a new canonical format to enable further processing before it hits the drawing routines. As a side-effect, this should make Flot more robust in the face of bad data. (issue 112) Step-wise charting: line charts have a new option \"steps\" that when set to true connects the points with horizontal/vertical steps instead of diagonal lines. The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just the label. (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier) Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun). Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked bars. New option to disable the (grid.show). Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an offset within the placeholder. Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to internal state. Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some hooks are defined, more are likely to come. Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines. Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use). Image plugin: plot prerendered images. Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot. More configurable grid. Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends). Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge). The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin. It's included inline in the Flot source to make dependency managing easier.

The usual trick here is wrap the above lines in an anonymous function which is called immediately, like this: (function () { inner code ... })(). To make it even more robust in case $ is not bound to jQuery but some other Javascript library, we can write it as ( function ( $ ) { // plugin definition // ... })( jQuery ); There's a complete example below, but you should also check out the plugins bundled with Flot. Complete example Here is a simple debug plugin which alerts each of the series in the plot. It has a single option that control whether it is enabled and how much info to output: ( function ( $ ) { function init ( plot ) { var debugLevel = 1 ; function checkDebugEnabled ( plot , options ) { if ( options . debug ) { debugLevel = options . debug ; plot . hooks . processDatapoints . push ( alertSeries ); } } function alertSeries ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var msg = \"series \" + series . label ; if ( debugLevel > 1 ) { msg += \" with \" + series . data . length + \" points\" ; alert ( msg ); } } plot . hooks . processOptions . push ( checkDebugEnabled ); } var options = { debug : 0 }; $ . plot . plugins . push ({ init : init , options : options , name : \"simpledebug\" , version : \"0.1\" }); })( jQuery ); We also define \"name\" and \"version\".

It can be enabled/disabled through an option. Variables in the init function can be used to store plot-specific state between the hooks. The two last points are important because there may be multiple plots on the same page, and you'd want to make sure they are not mixed up. Shutting down a plugin Each plot object has a shutdown hook which is run when plot.shutdown() is called. This usually mostly happens in case another plot is made on top of an existing one. The purpose of the hook is to give you a chance to unbind any event handlers you've registered and remove any extra DOM things you've inserted. The problem with event handlers is that you can have registered a handler which is run in some point in the future, e.g. with setTimeout(). Meanwhile, the plot may have been shutdown and removed, but because your event handler is still referencing it, it can't be garbage collected yet, and worse, if your handler eventually runs, it may overwrite stuff on a completely different plot. Some hints on the options Plugins should always support appropriate options to enable/disable them because the plugin user may have several plots on the same page where only one should use the plugin. In most cases it's probably a good idea if the plugin is turned off rather than on per default, just like most of the powerful features in Flot. If the plugin needs options that are specific to each series, like the points or lines options in core Flot, you can put them in \"series\" in the options object, e.g. var options = { series : { downsample : { algorithm : null , maxpoints : 1000 } } } Then they will be copied by Flot into each series, providing default values in case none are specified.

You can also force a particular lesser mode (canvas or HTML). In both CSS and canvas modes, the y-axis labels are rotated to face the graph (90 degrees counter-clockwise for left-hand labels, and 90 degrees clockwise for right-hand labels). In HTML mode, y-axis labels are left horizontal (warning: this takes up a lot of space). In CSS and HTML modes, each axis label belongs to the classes \"axisLabels\" and \"[axisName]Label\" (e.g. .xaxisLabel, .y2axisLabel, etc). You can use standard CSS properties to customize their appearance. In canvas mode, you can set font size, family, and colour through flot options (see below). Example $(function () { var options = { axisLabels: { show: true }, xaxes: [{ axisLabel: 'foo', }], yaxes: [{ position: 'left', axisLabel: 'bar', }, { position: 'right', axisLabel: 'bleem' }] }; $.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), yourData, options); ); }); Usage flot-axislabel adds an axisLabels object to the global options object. It supports one option: show (bool): display all axis labels (default: true) There are also several options added to the axis objects. The two main ones are axisLabel (string): the text you want displayed as the label axisLabelPadding (int): padding, in pixels, between the tick labels and the axis label (default: 2) By default, if supported, flot-axislabels uses CSS transforms. You can force either canvas or HTML mode by setting axisLabelUseCanvas or axisLabelUseHtml, respectively, to true. Canvas mode supports several other options: axisLabelFontSizePixels (int): the size, in pixels, of the font (default: 14) axisLabelFontFamily (string): the font family of the font (default: sans-serif) axisLabelColour (string): the font colour (default: black) Compatibility flot-axislabels should work with recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. It also works with IE 8 and 9. The canvas option does not seem to work with IE 8, even with excanvas.

Read more at the website: http://www.flotcharts.org/ Take a look at the the examples in examples/index.html; they should give a good impression of what Flot can do, and the source code of the examples is probably the fastest way to learn how to use Flot. Installation Just include the Javascript file after you've included jQuery. Generally, all browsers that support the HTML5 canvas tag are supported. For support for Internet Explorer < 9, you can use Excanvas , a canvas emulator; this is used in the examples bundled with Flot. You just include the excanvas script like this: <!--[if lte IE 8]><script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"excanvas.min.js\"></script><![endif]--> If it's not working on your development IE 6.0, check that it has support for VML which Excanvas is relying on. It appears that some stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines lack the VML support. You can also try using Flashcanvas , which uses Flash to do the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML, if you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster overall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which Flashcanvas is compatible with. You need at least jQuery 1.2.6, but try at least 1.3.2 for interactive charts because of performance improvements in event handling. Basic usage Create a placeholder div to put the graph in: < div id = \"placeholder\" ></ div > You need to set the width and height of this div, otherwise the plot library doesn't know how to scale the graph. You can do it inline like this: < div id = \"placeholder\" style = \"width:600px;height:300px\" ></ div > You can also do it with an external stylesheet. Make sure that the placeholder isn't within something with a display:none CSS property - in that case, Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which results in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the placeholder dimensions which is fatal (it'll throw an exception). Then when the div is ready in the DOM, which is usually on document ready, run the plot function: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), data , options ); Here, data is an array of data series and options is an object with settings if you want to customize the plot. Take a look at the examples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the API reference . Here's a quick example that'll draw a line from (0, 0) to (1, 1): $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ [[ 0 , 0 ], [ 1 , 1 ]] ], { yaxis : { max : 1 } }); The plot function immediately draws the chart and then returns a plot object with a couple of methods. What's with the name? First: it's pronounced with a short o, like \"plot\". Not like \"flawed\". So \"Flot\" rhymes with \"plot\". And if you look up \"flot\" in a Danish-to-English dictionary, some of the words that come up are \"good-looking\", \"attractive\", \"stylish\", \"smart\", \"impressive\", \"extravagant\". One of the main goals with Flot is pretty looks. Notes about the examples In order to have a useful, functional example of time-series plots using time zones, date.js from timezone-js (released under the Apache 2.0 license) and the Olson time zone database (released to the public domain) have been included in the examples directory.

One of the main goals with Flot is pretty looks.","title":"What's with the name?"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/#notes-about-the-examples","text":"In order to have a useful, functional example of time-series plots using time zones, date.js from timezone-js (released under the Apache 2.0 license) and the Olson time zone database (released to the public domain) have been included in the examples directory.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below. Note that in general Flot gives no guarantees if you change any of the objects you pass in to the plot function or get out of it since they're not necessarily deep-copied. Data Format The data is an array of data series: [ series1 , series2 , ... ] A series can either be raw data or an object with properties. The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ] Plot Options All options are completely optional. They are documented individually below, to change them you just specify them in an object, e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true }, points : { show : true } } }; $ . plot ( placeholder , data , options ); Customizing the legend legend : { show : boolean labelFormatter : null or ( fn : string , series object -> string ) labelBoxBorderColor : color noColumns : number position : \"ne\" or \"nw\" or \"se\" or \"sw\" margin : number of pixels or [ x margin , y margin ] backgroundColor : null or color backgroundOpacity : number between 0 and 1 container : null or jQuery object / DOM element / jQuery expression sorted : null / false , true , \"ascending\" , \"descending\" , \"reverse\" , or a comparator } The legend is generated as a table with the data series labels and small label boxes with the color of the series. If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) } Customizing the axes xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places. Multiple axes If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\". Time series data Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between. Customizing the data series series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme. Customizing the grid grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device). The default is capped to 60 frames per second. You can set it to -1 to disable the rate limiting. Specifying gradients A gradient is specified like this: { colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] } For instance, you might specify a background on the grid going from black to gray like this: grid : { backgroundColor : { colors : [ \"#000\" , \"#999\" ] } } For the series you can specify the gradient as an object that specifies the scaling of the brightness and the opacity of the series color, e.g. { colors : [{ opacity : 0.8 }, { brightness : 0.6 , opacity : 0.8 } ] } where the first color simply has its alpha scaled, whereas the second is also darkened. For instance, for bars the following makes the bars gradually disappear, without outline: bars : { show : true , lineWidth : 0 , fill : true , fillColor : { colors : [ { opacity : 0.8 }, { opacity : 0.1 } ] } } Flot currently only supports vertical gradients drawn from top to bottom because that's what works with IE. Plot Methods The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you can call: highlight(series, datapoint) Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change. Hooks In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info. Plugins Plugins extend the functionality of Flot. To use a plugin, simply include its Javascript file after Flot in the HTML page. If you're worried about download size/latency, you can concatenate all the plugins you use, and Flot itself for that matter, into one big file (make sure you get the order right), then optionally run it through a Javascript minifier such as YUI Compressor. Here's a brief explanation of how the plugin plumbings work: Each plugin registers itself in the global array $.plot.plugins. When you make a new plot object with $.plot, Flot goes through this array calling the \"init\" function of each plugin and merging default options from the \"option\" attribute of the plugin. The init function gets a reference to the plot object created and uses this to register hooks and add new public methods if needed. See the PLUGINS document for details on how to write a plugin. As the above description hints, it's actually pretty easy.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below. Note that in general Flot gives no guarantees if you change any of the objects you pass in to the plot function or get out of it since they're not necessarily deep-copied.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#data-format","text":"The data is an array of data series: [ series1 , series2 , ... ] A series can either be raw data or an object with properties. The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ]","title":"Data Format"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plot-options","text":"All options are completely optional.

If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) }","title":"Customizing the legend"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-axes","text":"xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places.","title":"Customizing the axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#multiple-axes","text":"If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\".","title":"Multiple axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#time-series-data","text":"Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between.","title":"Time series data"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-data-series","text":"series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme.","title":"Customizing the data series"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-grid","text":"grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device). The default is capped to 60 frames per second. You can set it to -1 to disable the rate limiting.","title":"Customizing the grid"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#specifying-gradients","text":"A gradient is specified like this: { colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] } For instance, you might specify a background on the grid going from black to gray like this: grid : { backgroundColor : { colors : [ \"#000\" , \"#999\" ] } } For the series you can specify the gradient as an object that specifies the scaling of the brightness and the opacity of the series color, e.g. { colors : [{ opacity : 0.8 }, { brightness : 0.6 , opacity : 0.8 } ] } where the first color simply has its alpha scaled, whereas the second is also darkened. For instance, for bars the following makes the bars gradually disappear, without outline: bars : { show : true , lineWidth : 0 , fill : true , fillColor : { colors : [ { opacity : 0.8 }, { opacity : 0.1 } ] } } Flot currently only supports vertical gradients drawn from top to bottom because that's what works with IE.","title":"Specifying gradients"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plot-methods","text":"The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you can call: highlight(series, datapoint) Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change.","title":"Plot Methods"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#hooks","text":"In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info.","title":"Hooks"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plugins","text":"Plugins extend the functionality of Flot. To use a plugin, simply include its Javascript file after Flot in the HTML page. If you're worried about download size/latency, you can concatenate all the plugins you use, and Flot itself for that matter, into one big file (make sure you get the order right), then optionally run it through a Javascript minifier such as YUI Compressor. Here's a brief explanation of how the plugin plumbings work: Each plugin registers itself in the global array $.plot.plugins. When you make a new plot object with $.plot, Flot goes through this array calling the \"init\" function of each plugin and merging default options from the \"option\" attribute of the plugin. The init function gets a reference to the plot object created and uses this to register hooks and add new public methods if needed. See the PLUGINS document for details on how to write a plugin.

Flot will happily draw everything you send to it so the answer depends on the browser. The excanvas emulation used for IE (built with VML) makes IE by far the slowest browser so be sure to test with that if IE users are in your target group (for large plots in IE, you can also check out Flashcanvas which may be faster). 1000 points is not a problem, but as soon as you start having more points than the pixel width, you should probably start thinking about downsampling/aggregation as this is near the resolution limit of the chart anyway. If you downsample server-side, you also save bandwidth. Flot isn't working when I'm using JSON data as source! Actually, Flot loves JSON data, you just got the format wrong. Double check that you're not inputting strings instead of numbers, like [[\"0\", \"-2.13\"], [\"5\", \"4.3\"]]. This is most common mistake, and the error might not show up immediately because Javascript can do some conversion automatically. Can I export the graph? You can grab the image rendered by the canvas element used by Flot as a PNG or JPEG (remember to set a background). Note that it won't include anything not drawn in the canvas (such as the legend). And it doesn't work with excanvas which uses VML, but you could try Flashcanvas. The bars are all tiny in time mode? It's not really possible to determine the bar width automatically. So you have to set the width with the barWidth option which is NOT in pixels, but in the units of the x axis (or the y axis for horizontal bars). For time mode that's milliseconds so the default value of 1 makes the bars 1 millisecond wide. Can I use Flot with libraries like Mootools or Prototype? Yes, Flot supports it out of the box and it's easy! Just use jQuery instead of $, e.g. call jQuery.plot instead of $.plot and use jQuery(something) instead of $(something). As a convenience, you can put in a DOM element for the graph placeholder where the examples and the API documentation are using jQuery objects.

If this is not working, it's probably because the framework you're using is doing something weird with the DOM or with the CSS that is interfering with Flot. A common problem is that there's display:none on a container until the user does something. Many tab widgets work this way, and there's nothing wrong with it - you just can't call Flot inside a display:none container as explained in the README so you need to hold off the Flot call until the container is actually displayed (or use visibility:hidden instead of display:none or move the container off-screen).

(patch by vird, pull request #1020) Fixed missing semicolons in the core library. (reported by Michal Zglinski) Flot 0.8.0 API changes Support for time series has been moved into a plugin, jquery.flot.time.js. This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540). Changes Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting.

(patch by Nick Campbell, pull request #852) Added a new option called 'zero' to bars and filled lines series, to control whether the y-axis minimum is scaled to fit the data or set to zero. (patch by David Schnur, issues #316, #529, and #856, pull request #911) The plot function is now also a jQuery chainable property. (patch by David Schnur, issues #734 and #816, pull request #953) When only a single pie slice is beneath the combine threshold it is no longer replaced by an 'other' slice. (suggested by Devin Bayer, issue #638) Added lineJoin and minSize options to the selection plugin to control the corner style and minimum size of the selection, respectively. (patch by Ruth Linehan, pull request #963) Bug fixes Fix problem with null values and pie plugin. (patch by gcruxifix, issue 500) Fix problem with threshold plugin and bars. (based on patch by kaarlenkaski, issue 348) Fix axis box calculations so the boxes include the outermost part of the labels too.

(patch by Lasse Dahl Ebert) Fixed various jQuery 1.8 compatibility issues. (issues #814 and #819, pull request #877) Pie charts with a slice equal to or approaching 100% of the pie no longer appear invisible. (patch by David Schnur, issues #444, #658, #726, #824 and #850, pull request #879) Prevented several local variables from becoming global. (patch by aaa707) Ensure that the overlay and primary canvases remain aligned. (issue #670, pull request #901) Added support for jQuery 1.9 by removing and replacing uses of $.browser. (analysis and patch by Anthony Ryan, pull request #905) Pie charts no longer disappear when redrawn during a resize or update. (reported by Julien Bec, issue #656, pull request #910) Avoided floating-point precision errors when calculating pie percentages.

(reported by zengge1984 and pareeohnos, issues #810 and #945) Added a work-around for the problem where points with a lineWidth of zero still showed up with a visible line. (reported by SalvoSav, issue #842, patch by Jamie Hamel-Smith, pull request #937) Pie charts now accept values in string form, like other plot types. (reported by laerdal.no, issue #534) Avoid rounding errors in the threshold plugin. (reported by jerikojerk, issue #895) Fixed an error when using the navigate plugin with jQuery 1.9.x or later. (reported by Paolo Valleri, issue #964) Fixed inconsistencies between the highlight and unhighlight functions. (reported by djamshed, issue #987) Fixed recalculation of tickSize and tickDecimals on calls to setupGrid. (patch by thecountofzero, pull request #861, issues #860, #1000) Flot 0.7 API changes Multiple axes support. Code using dual axes should be changed from using x2axis/y2axis in the options to using an array (although backwards- compatibility hooks are in place). For instance, { xaxis : { ... }, x2axis : { ... }, yaxis : { ... }, y2axis : { ... } } becomes { xaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ], yaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ] } Note that if you're just using one axis, continue to use the xaxis/yaxis directly (it now sets the default settings for the arrays). Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra axes into account, check the source to see some examples. A related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected. So if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in the chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly. \"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a corresponding option on the axes, so: { grid : { tickColor : \"#000\" }} becomes { xaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" }, yaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" } } But if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a tick color by adding transparency. Backwards-compatibility hooks are in place. Final note: now that IE 9 is coming out with canvas support, you may want to adapt the excanvas include to skip loading it in IE 9 (the examples have been adapted thanks to Ryley Breiddal). An alternative to excanvas using Flash has also surfaced, if your graphs are slow in IE, you may want to give it a spin: http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/ Changes Support for specifying a bottom for each point for line charts when filling them, this means that an arbitrary bottom can be used instead of just the x axis. (based on patches patiently provided by Roman V. Prikhodchenko) New fillbetween plugin that can compute a bottom for a series from another series, useful for filling areas between lines. See new example percentiles.html for a use case. More predictable handling of gaps for the stacking plugin, now all undefined ranges are skipped. Stacking plugin can stack horizontal bar charts. Navigate plugin now redraws the plot while panning instead of only after the fact. (raised by lastthemy, issue 235) Can be disabled by setting the pan.frameRate option to null. Date formatter now accepts %0m and %0d to get a zero-padded month or day. (issue raised by Maximillian Dornseif) Revamped internals to support an unlimited number of axes, not just dual. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) New setting on axes, \"tickLength\", to control the size of ticks or turn them off without turning off the labels. Axis labels are now put in container divs with classes, for instance labels in the x axes can be reached via \".xAxis .tickLabel\". Support for setting the color of an axis. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Tick color is now auto-generated as the base color with some transparency, unless you override it. Support for aligning ticks in the axes with \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to ensure that they appear next to each other rather than in between, at the expense of possibly awkward tick steps. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Support for customizing the point type through a callback when plotting points and new symbol plugin with some predefined point types. (sponsored by Utility Data Corporation) Resize plugin for automatically redrawing when the placeholder changes size, e.g. on window resizes. (sponsored by Novus Partners) A resize() method has been added to plot object facilitate this. Support Infinity/-Infinity for plotting asymptotes by hacking it into +/-Number.MAX_VALUE. (reported by rabaea.mircea) Support for restricting navigate plugin to not pan/zoom an axis. (based on patch by kkaefer) Support for providing the drag cursor for the navigate plugin as an option. (based on patch by Kelly T. Moore) Options for controlling whether an axis is shown or not (suggestion by Timo Tuominen) and whether to reserve space for it even if it isn't shown. New attribute $.plot.version with the Flot version as a string. The version comment is now included in the minified jquery.flot.min.js. New options.grid.minBorderMargin for adjusting the minimum margin provided around the border (based on patch by corani, issue 188). Refactor replot behaviour so Flot tries to reuse the existing canvas, adding shutdown() methods to the plot. (based on patch by Ryley Breiddal, issue 269) This prevents a memory leak in Chrome and hopefully makes replotting faster for those who are using $.plot instead of .setData()/.draw(). Also update jQuery to 1.5.1 to prevent IE leaks fixed in jQuery. New real-time line chart example. New hooks: drawSeries, shutdown. Bug fixes Fixed problem with findNearbyItem and bars on top of each other. (reported by ragingchikn, issue 242) Fixed problem with ticks and the border. (based on patch from ultimatehustler69, issue 236) Fixed problem with plugins adding options to the series objects. Fixed a problem introduced in 0.6 with specifying a gradient with: {brightness: x, opacity: y } Don't use $.browser.msie, check for getContext on the created canvas element instead and try to use excanvas if it's not found. Fixes IE 9 compatibility. highlight(s, index) was looking up the point in the original s.data instead of in the computed datapoints array, which breaks with plugins that modify the datapoints, such as the stacking plugin. (reported by curlypaul924, issue 316) More robust handling of axis from data passed in from getData(). (reported) by Morgan) Fixed problem with turning off bar outline. (fix by Jordi Castells, issue 253) Check the selection passed into setSelection in the selection plugin, to guard against errors when synchronizing plots (fix by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Fix bug in crosshair code with mouseout resetting the crosshair even if it is locked (fix by Lau Bech Lauritzen and Banko Adam). Fix bug with points plotting using line width from lines rather than points. Fix bug with passing non-array 0 data (for plugins that don't expect arrays, patch by vpapp1). Fix errors in JSON in examples so they work with jQuery 1.4.2 (fix reported by honestbleeps, issue 357). Fix bug with tooltip in interacting.html, this makes the tooltip much smoother (fix by bdkahn). Fix related bug inside highlighting handler in Flot. Use closure trick to make inline colorhelpers plugin respect jQuery.noConflict(true), renaming the global jQuery object (reported by Nick Stielau). Listen for mouseleave events and fire a plothover event with empty item when it occurs to drop highlights when the mouse leaves the plot (reported by by outspirit). Fix bug with using aboveData with a background (reported by amitayd). Fix possible excanvas leak (report and suggested fix by tom9729). Fix bug with backwards compatibility for shadowSize = 0 (report and suggested fix by aspinak). Adapt examples to skip loading excanvas (fix by Ryley Breiddal). Fix bug that prevent a simple f(x) = -x transform from working correctly (fix by Mike, issue 263). Fix bug in restoring cursor in navigate plugin (reported by Matteo Gattanini, issue 395). Fix bug in picking items when transform/inverseTransform is in use (reported by Ofri Raviv, and patches and analysis by Jan and Tom Paton, issue 334 and 467). Fix problem with unaligned ticks and hover/click events caused by padding on the placeholder by hardcoding the placeholder padding to 0 (reported by adityadineshsaxena, Matt Sommer, Daniel Atos and some other people, issue 301). Update colorhelpers plugin to avoid dying when trying to parse an invalid string (reported by cadavor, issue 483). Flot 0.6 API changes Selection support has been moved to a plugin. Thus if you're passing selection: { mode: something }, you MUST include the file jquery.flot.selection.js after jquery.flot.js. This reduces the size of base Flot and makes it easier to customize the selection as well as improving code clarity. The change is based on a patch from andershol. In the global options specified in the $.plot command, \"lines\", \"points\", \"bars\" and \"shadowSize\" have been moved to a sub-object called \"series\": $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { lines : { show : true }}) should be changed to $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { series : { lines : { show : true }}}) All future series-specific options will go into this sub-object to simplify plugin writing. Backward-compatibility code is in place, so old code should not break. \"plothover\" no longer provides the original data point, but instead a normalized one, since there may be no corresponding original point. Due to a bug in previous versions of jQuery, you now need at least jQuery 1.2.6. But if you can, try jQuery 1.3.2 as it got some improvements in event handling speed. Changes Added support for disabling interactivity for specific data series. (request from Ronald Schouten and Steve Upton) Flot now calls $() on the placeholder and optional legend container passed in so you can specify DOM elements or CSS expressions to make it easier to use Flot with libraries like Prototype or Mootools or through raw JSON from Ajax responses. A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making a selection. The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most 10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if you're doing something really expensive on this event. The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even replaced. Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid. (patches from Amaury Chamayou and Mike R. Williamson) Added support for gradient backgrounds for the grid. (based on patch from Amaury Chamayou, issue 90) The \"setting options\" example provides a demonstration. Gradient bars. (suggestion by stefpet) Added a \"plotunselected\" event which is triggered when the selection is removed, see \"selection\" example. (suggestion by Meda Ugo) The option legend.margin can now specify horizontal and vertical margins independently. (suggestion by someone who's annoyed) Data passed into Flot is now copied to a new canonical format to enable further processing before it hits the drawing routines. As a side-effect, this should make Flot more robust in the face of bad data. (issue 112) Step-wise charting: line charts have a new option \"steps\" that when set to true connects the points with horizontal/vertical steps instead of diagonal lines. The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just the label. (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier) Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun). Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked bars. New option to disable the (grid.show). Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an offset within the placeholder. Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to internal state. Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some hooks are defined, more are likely to come. Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines. Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use). Image plugin: plot prerendered images. Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot. More configurable grid. Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends). Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge). The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin. It's included inline in the Flot source to make dependency managing easier. This also makes it really easy to use the color helpers in Flot plugins. Bug fixes Fixed two corner-case bugs when drawing filled curves. (report and analysis by Joshua Varner) Fix auto-adjustment code when setting min to 0 for an axis where the dataset is completely flat on that axis. (report by chovy) Fixed a bug with passing in data from getData to setData when the secondary axes are used. (reported by nperelman, issue 65) Fixed so that it is possible to turn lines off when no other chart type is shown (based on problem reported by Glenn Vanderburg), and fixed so that setting lineWidth to 0 also hides the shadow. (based on problem reported by Sergio Nunes) Updated mousemove position expression to the latest from jQuery. (reported by meyuchas) Use CSS borders instead of background in legend. (issues 25 and 45) Explicitly convert axis min/max to numbers. Fixed a bug with drawing marking lines with different colors. (reported by Khurram) Fixed a bug with returning y2 values in the selection event. (fix by exists, issue 75) Only set position relative on placeholder if it hasn't already a position different from static. (reported by kyberneticist, issue 95) Don't round markings to prevent sub-pixel problems. (reported by Dan Lipsitt) Make the grid border act similarly to a regular CSS border, i.e. prevent it from overlapping the plot itself. This also fixes a problem with anti- aliasing when the width is 1 pixel. (reported by Anthony Ettinger) Imported version 3 of excanvas and fixed two issues with the newer version. Hopefully, this will make Flot work with IE8. (nudge by Fabien Menager, further analysis by Booink, issue 133) Changed the shadow code for lines to hopefully look a bit better with vertical lines. Round tick positions to avoid possible problems with fractions. (suggestion by Fred, issue 130) Made the heuristic for determining how many ticks to aim for a bit smarter. Fix for uneven axis margins (report and patch by Paul Kienzle) and snapping to ticks. (report and patch by lifthrasiir) Fixed bug with slicing in findNearbyItems. (patch by zollman) Make heuristic for x axis label widths more dynamic. (patch by rickinhethuis) Make sure points on top take precedence when finding nearby points when hovering. (reported by didroe, issue 224) Flot 0.5 Timestamps are now in UTC. Also \"selected\" event -> becomes \"plotselected\" with new data, the parameters for setSelection are now different (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place), coloredAreas becomes markings with a new interface (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place). API changes Timestamps in time mode are now displayed according to UTC instead of the time zone of the visitor. This affects the way the timestamps should be input; you'll probably have to offset the timestamps according to your local time zone. It also affects any custom date handling code (which basically now should use the equivalent UTC date mehods, e.g. .setUTCMonth() instead of .setMonth(). Markings, previously coloredAreas, are now specified as ranges on the axes, like { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }} . Furthermore with markings you can now draw horizontal/vertical lines by setting from and to to the same coordinate. (idea from line support patch by by Ryan Funduk) Interactivity: added a new \"plothover\" event and this and the \"plotclick\" event now returns the closest data item (based on patch by /david, patch by Mark Byers for bar support). See the revamped \"interacting with the data\" example for some hints on what you can do. Highlighting: you can now highlight points and datapoints are autohighlighted when you hover over them (if hovering is turned on). Support for dual axis has been added (based on patch by someone who's annoyed and /david). For each data series you can specify which axes it belongs to, and there are two more axes, x2axis and y2axis, to customize. This affects the \"selected\" event which has been renamed to \"plotselected\" and spews out { xaxis: { from: -10, to: 20 } ... }, setSelection in which the parameters are on a new form (backwards compatible hooks are in place so old code shouldn't break) and markings (formerly coloredAreas). Changes Added support for specifying the size of tick labels (axis.labelWidth, axis.labelHeight). Useful for specifying a max label size to keep multiple plots aligned. The \"fill\" option can now be a number that specifies the opacity of the fill. You can now specify a coordinate as null (like [2, null]) and Flot will take the other coordinate into account when scaling the axes. (based on patch by joebno) New option for bars \"align\". Set it to \"center\" to center the bars on the value they represent. setSelection now takes a second parameter which you can use to prevent the method from firing the \"plotselected\" handler. Improved the handling of axis auto-scaling with bars. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in calculating spacing around the plot. (reported by timothytoe) Fixed a bug in finding max values for all-negative data sets. Prevent the possibility of eternal looping in tick calculations. Fixed a bug when borderWidth is set to 0. (reported by Rob/sanchothefat) Fixed a bug with drawing bars extending below 0. (reported by James Hewitt, patch by Ryan Funduk). Fixed a bug with line widths of bars. (reported by MikeM) Fixed a bug with 'nw' and 'sw' legend positions. Fixed a bug with multi-line x-axis tick labels. (reported by Luca Ciano, IE-fix help by Savage Zhang) Using the \"container\" option in legend now overwrites the container element instead of just appending to it, fixing the infinite legend bug. (reported by several people, fix by Brad Dewey) Flot 0.4 API changes Deprecated axis.noTicks in favor of just specifying the number as axis.ticks. So xaxis: { noTicks: 10 } becomes xaxis: { ticks: 10 } . Time series support. Specify axis.mode: \"time\", put in Javascript timestamps as data, and Flot will automatically spit out sensible ticks. Take a look at the two new examples. The format can be customized with axis.timeformat and axis.monthNames, or if that fails with axis.tickFormatter. Support for colored background areas via grid.coloredAreas. Specify an array of { x1, y1, x2, y2 } objects or a function that returns these given { xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax }. More members on the plot object (report by Chris Davies and others). \"getData\" for inspecting the assigned settings on data series (e.g. color) and \"setData\", \"setupGrid\" and \"draw\" for updating the contents without a total replot. The default number of ticks to aim for is now dependent on the size of the plot in pixels. Support for customizing tick interval sizes directly with axis.minTickSize and axis.tickSize. Cleaned up the automatic axis scaling algorithm and fixed how it interacts with ticks. Also fixed a couple of tick-related corner case bugs (one reported by mainstreetmark, another reported by timothytoe). The option axis.tickFormatter now takes a function with two parameters, the second parameter is an optional object with information about the axis. It has min, max, tickDecimals, tickSize. Changes Added support for segmented lines. (based on patch from Michael MacDonald) Added support for ignoring null and bad values. (suggestion from Nick Konidaris and joshwaihi) Added support for changing the border width. (thanks to joebno and safoo) Label colors can be changed via CSS by selecting the tickLabel class. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in handling single-item bar series. (reported by Emil Filipov) Fixed erratic behaviour when interacting with the plot with IE 7. (reported by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Prevent IE/Safari text selection when selecting stuff on the canvas. Flot 0.3 This is mostly a quick-fix release because jquery.js wasn't included in the previous zip/tarball. Changes Include jquery.js in the zip/tarball. Support clicking on the plot. Turn it on with grid: { clickable: true }, then you get a \"plotclick\" event on the graph placeholder with the position in units of the plot. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in dealing with data where min = max. (thanks to Michael Messinides) Flot 0.2 The API should now be fully documented. API changes Moved labelMargin option to grid from x/yaxis. Changes Added support for putting a background behind the default legend. The default is the partly transparent background color. Added backgroundColor and backgroundOpacity to the legend options to control this. The ticks options can now be a callback function that takes one parameter, an object with the attributes min and max. The function should return a ticks array. Added labelFormatter option in legend, useful for turning the legend labels into links. Reduced the size of the code.

This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540).","title":"API changes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t2-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/NEWS/#changes_2","text":"Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting.

Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra axes into account, check the source to see some examples. A related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected.

Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy).

Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines.

Round tick positions to avoid possible problems with fractions. (suggestion by Fred, issue 130) Made the heuristic for determining how many ticks to aim for a bit smarter. Fix for uneven axis margins (report and patch by Paul Kienzle) and snapping to ticks. (report and patch by lifthrasiir) Fixed bug with slicing in findNearbyItems.

Highlighting: you can now highlight points and datapoints are autohighlighted when you hover over them (if hovering is turned on). Support for dual axis has been added (based on patch by someone who's annoyed and /david). For each data series you can specify which axes it belongs to, and there are two more axes, x2axis and y2axis, to customize.

The usual trick here is wrap the above lines in an anonymous function which is called immediately, like this: (function () { inner code ... })(). To make it even more robust in case $ is not bound to jQuery but some other Javascript library, we can write it as ( function ( $ ) { // plugin definition // ... })( jQuery ); There's a complete example below, but you should also check out the plugins bundled with Flot. Complete example Here is a simple debug plugin which alerts each of the series in the plot. It has a single option that control whether it is enabled and how much info to output: ( function ( $ ) { function init ( plot ) { var debugLevel = 1 ; function checkDebugEnabled ( plot , options ) { if ( options . debug ) { debugLevel = options . debug ; plot . hooks . processDatapoints . push ( alertSeries ); } } function alertSeries ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var msg = \"series \" + series . label ; if ( debugLevel > 1 ) { msg += \" with \" + series . data . length + \" points\" ; alert ( msg ); } } plot . hooks . processOptions . push ( checkDebugEnabled ); } var options = { debug : 0 }; $ . plot . plugins . push ({ init : init , options : options , name : \"simpledebug\" , version : \"0.1\" }); })( jQuery ); We also define \"name\" and \"version\". It's not used by Flot, but might be helpful for other plugins in resolving dependencies. Put the above in a file named \"jquery.flot.debug.js\", include it in an HTML page and then it can be used with: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [...], { debug : 2 }); This simple plugin illustrates a couple of points: It uses the anonymous function trick to avoid name pollution. It can be enabled/disabled through an option. Variables in the init function can be used to store plot-specific state between the hooks. The two last points are important because there may be multiple plots on the same page, and you'd want to make sure they are not mixed up. Shutting down a plugin Each plot object has a shutdown hook which is run when plot.shutdown() is called. This usually mostly happens in case another plot is made on top of an existing one. The purpose of the hook is to give you a chance to unbind any event handlers you've registered and remove any extra DOM things you've inserted. The problem with event handlers is that you can have registered a handler which is run in some point in the future, e.g. with setTimeout(). Meanwhile, the plot may have been shutdown and removed, but because your event handler is still referencing it, it can't be garbage collected yet, and worse, if your handler eventually runs, it may overwrite stuff on a completely different plot. Some hints on the options Plugins should always support appropriate options to enable/disable them because the plugin user may have several plots on the same page where only one should use the plugin. In most cases it's probably a good idea if the plugin is turned off rather than on per default, just like most of the powerful features in Flot. If the plugin needs options that are specific to each series, like the points or lines options in core Flot, you can put them in \"series\" in the options object, e.g. var options = { series : { downsample : { algorithm : null , maxpoints : 1000 } } } Then they will be copied by Flot into each series, providing default values in case none are specified.

Maintained by Mark Cote. Contributions: Xuan Luo Mark Cote stdexcept Clemens Stolle Michael Haddon andig Alex Pinkney flot-axislabels provides flot with the ability to label axes. It supports any number of axes. It can render the labels with CSS transforms, in canvas, or with traditional CSS positioning (\"HTML\" mode). flot-axislabels attempts a graceful fallback from CSS to canvas to HTML if some modes are not supported. You can also force a particular lesser mode (canvas or HTML). In both CSS and canvas modes, the y-axis labels are rotated to face the graph (90 degrees counter-clockwise for left-hand labels, and 90 degrees clockwise for right-hand labels). In HTML mode, y-axis labels are left horizontal (warning: this takes up a lot of space). In CSS and HTML modes, each axis label belongs to the classes \"axisLabels\" and \"[axisName]Label\" (e.g. .xaxisLabel, .y2axisLabel, etc). You can use standard CSS properties to customize their appearance. In canvas mode, you can set font size, family, and colour through flot options (see below). Example $(function () { var options = { axisLabels: { show: true }, xaxes: [{ axisLabel: 'foo', }], yaxes: [{ position: 'left', axisLabel: 'bar', }, { position: 'right', axisLabel: 'bleem' }] }; $.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), yourData, options); ); }); Usage flot-axislabel adds an axisLabels object to the global options object. It supports one option: show (bool): display all axis labels (default: true) There are also several options added to the axis objects. The two main ones are axisLabel (string): the text you want displayed as the label axisLabelPadding (int): padding, in pixels, between the tick labels and the axis label (default: 2) By default, if supported, flot-axislabels uses CSS transforms. You can force either canvas or HTML mode by setting axisLabelUseCanvas or axisLabelUseHtml, respectively, to true. Canvas mode supports several other options: axisLabelFontSizePixels (int): the size, in pixels, of the font (default: 14) axisLabelFontFamily (string): the font family of the font (default: sans-serif) axisLabelColour (string): the font colour (default: black) Compatibility flot-axislabels should work with recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. It also works with IE 8 and 9. The canvas option does not seem to work with IE 8, even with excanvas.

Installation Just include the Javascript file after you've included jQuery. Generally, all browsers that support the HTML5 canvas tag are supported. For support for Internet Explorer < 9, you can use Excanvas , a canvas emulator; this is used in the examples bundled with Flot. You just include the excanvas script like this: <!--[if lte IE 8]><script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"excanvas.min.js\"></script><![endif]--> If it's not working on your development IE 6.0, check that it has support for VML which Excanvas is relying on. It appears that some stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines lack the VML support. You can also try using Flashcanvas , which uses Flash to do the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML, if you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster overall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which Flashcanvas is compatible with. You need at least jQuery 1.2.6, but try at least 1.3.2 for interactive charts because of performance improvements in event handling. Basic usage Create a placeholder div to put the graph in: < div id = \"placeholder\" ></ div > You need to set the width and height of this div, otherwise the plot library doesn't know how to scale the graph. You can do it inline like this: < div id = \"placeholder\" style = \"width:600px;height:300px\" ></ div > You can also do it with an external stylesheet. Make sure that the placeholder isn't within something with a display:none CSS property - in that case, Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which results in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the placeholder dimensions which is fatal (it'll throw an exception). Then when the div is ready in the DOM, which is usually on document ready, run the plot function: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), data , options ); Here, data is an array of data series and options is an object with settings if you want to customize the plot. Take a look at the examples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the API reference . Here's a quick example that'll draw a line from (0, 0) to (1, 1): $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ [[ 0 , 0 ], [ 1 , 1 ]] ], { yaxis : { max : 1 } }); The plot function immediately draws the chart and then returns a plot object with a couple of methods. What's with the name? First: it's pronounced with a short o, like \"plot\". Not like \"flawed\". So \"Flot\" rhymes with \"plot\". And if you look up \"flot\" in a Danish-to-English dictionary, some of the words that come up are \"good-looking\", \"attractive\", \"stylish\", \"smart\", \"impressive\", \"extravagant\". One of the main goals with Flot is pretty looks. Notes about the examples In order to have a useful, functional example of time-series plots using time zones, date.js from timezone-js (released under the Apache 2.0 license) and the Olson time zone database (released to the public domain) have been included in the examples directory.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below. Note that in general Flot gives no guarantees if you change any of the objects you pass in to the plot function or get out of it since they're not necessarily deep-copied. Data Format The data is an array of data series: [ series1 , series2 , ... ] A series can either be raw data or an object with properties. The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ] Plot Options All options are completely optional. They are documented individually below, to change them you just specify them in an object, e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true }, points : { show : true } } }; $ . plot ( placeholder , data , options ); Customizing the legend legend : { show : boolean labelFormatter : null or ( fn : string , series object -> string ) labelBoxBorderColor : color noColumns : number position : \"ne\" or \"nw\" or \"se\" or \"sw\" margin : number of pixels or [ x margin , y margin ] backgroundColor : null or color backgroundOpacity : number between 0 and 1 container : null or jQuery object / DOM element / jQuery expression sorted : null / false , true , \"ascending\" , \"descending\" , \"reverse\" , or a comparator } The legend is generated as a table with the data series labels and small label boxes with the color of the series. If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) } Customizing the axes xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places. Multiple axes If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\". Time series data Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between. Customizing the data series series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme. Customizing the grid grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device). The default is capped to 60 frames per second. You can set it to -1 to disable the rate limiting. Specifying gradients A gradient is specified like this: { colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] } For instance, you might specify a background on the grid going from black to gray like this: grid : { backgroundColor : { colors : [ \"#000\" , \"#999\" ] } } For the series you can specify the gradient as an object that specifies the scaling of the brightness and the opacity of the series color, e.g. { colors : [{ opacity : 0.8 }, { brightness : 0.6 , opacity : 0.8 } ] } where the first color simply has its alpha scaled, whereas the second is also darkened. For instance, for bars the following makes the bars gradually disappear, without outline: bars : { show : true , lineWidth : 0 , fill : true , fillColor : { colors : [ { opacity : 0.8 }, { opacity : 0.1 } ] } } Flot currently only supports vertical gradients drawn from top to bottom because that's what works with IE. Plot Methods The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you can call: highlight(series, datapoint) Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change. Hooks In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info. Plugins Plugins extend the functionality of Flot. To use a plugin, simply include its Javascript file after Flot in the HTML page. If you're worried about download size/latency, you can concatenate all the plugins you use, and Flot itself for that matter, into one big file (make sure you get the order right), then optionally run it through a Javascript minifier such as YUI Compressor. Here's a brief explanation of how the plugin plumbings work: Each plugin registers itself in the global array $.plot.plugins. When you make a new plot object with $.plot, Flot goes through this array calling the \"init\" function of each plugin and merging default options from the \"option\" attribute of the plugin. The init function gets a reference to the plot object created and uses this to register hooks and add new public methods if needed. See the PLUGINS document for details on how to write a plugin. As the above description hints, it's actually pretty easy.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below.

The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ]","title":"Data Format"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plot-options","text":"All options are completely optional.

If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) }","title":"Customizing the legend"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-axes","text":"xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places.","title":"Customizing the axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#multiple-axes","text":"If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\".","title":"Multiple axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#time-series-data","text":"Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between.","title":"Time series data"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-data-series","text":"series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme.","title":"Customizing the data series"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-grid","text":"grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device). The default is capped to 60 frames per second. You can set it to -1 to disable the rate limiting.","title":"Customizing the grid"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#specifying-gradients","text":"A gradient is specified like this: { colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] } For instance, you might specify a background on the grid going from black to gray like this: grid : { backgroundColor : { colors : [ \"#000\" , \"#999\" ] } } For the series you can specify the gradient as an object that specifies the scaling of the brightness and the opacity of the series color, e.g. { colors : [{ opacity : 0.8 }, { brightness : 0.6 , opacity : 0.8 } ] } where the first color simply has its alpha scaled, whereas the second is also darkened. For instance, for bars the following makes the bars gradually disappear, without outline: bars : { show : true , lineWidth : 0 , fill : true , fillColor : { colors : [ { opacity : 0.8 }, { opacity : 0.1 } ] } } Flot currently only supports vertical gradients drawn from top to bottom because that's what works with IE.","title":"Specifying gradients"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plot-methods","text":"The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you can call: highlight(series, datapoint) Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change.","title":"Plot Methods"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#hooks","text":"In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info.","title":"Hooks"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plugins","text":"Plugins extend the functionality of Flot.

Flot will happily draw everything you send to it so the answer depends on the browser. The excanvas emulation used for IE (built with VML) makes IE by far the slowest browser so be sure to test with that if IE users are in your target group (for large plots in IE, you can also check out Flashcanvas which may be faster). 1000 points is not a problem, but as soon as you start having more points than the pixel width, you should probably start thinking about downsampling/aggregation as this is near the resolution limit of the chart anyway. If you downsample server-side, you also save bandwidth. Flot isn't working when I'm using JSON data as source! Actually, Flot loves JSON data, you just got the format wrong. Double check that you're not inputting strings instead of numbers, like [[\"0\", \"-2.13\"], [\"5\", \"4.3\"]]. This is most common mistake, and the error might not show up immediately because Javascript can do some conversion automatically. Can I export the graph? You can grab the image rendered by the canvas element used by Flot as a PNG or JPEG (remember to set a background). Note that it won't include anything not drawn in the canvas (such as the legend). And it doesn't work with excanvas which uses VML, but you could try Flashcanvas. The bars are all tiny in time mode? It's not really possible to determine the bar width automatically. So you have to set the width with the barWidth option which is NOT in pixels, but in the units of the x axis (or the y axis for horizontal bars). For time mode that's milliseconds so the default value of 1 makes the bars 1 millisecond wide. Can I use Flot with libraries like Mootools or Prototype? Yes, Flot supports it out of the box and it's easy! Just use jQuery instead of $, e.g. call jQuery.plot instead of $.plot and use jQuery(something) instead of $(something). As a convenience, you can put in a DOM element for the graph placeholder where the examples and the API documentation are using jQuery objects. Depending on how you include jQuery, you may have to add one line of code to prevent jQuery from overwriting functions from the other libraries, see the documentation in jQuery (\"Using jQuery with other libraries\") for details. Flot doesn't work with [insert name of Javascript UI framework]! Flot is using standard HTML to make charts. If this is not working, it's probably because the framework you're using is doing something weird with the DOM or with the CSS that is interfering with Flot. A common problem is that there's display:none on a container until the user does something. Many tab widgets work this way, and there's nothing wrong with it - you just can't call Flot inside a display:none container as explained in the README so you need to hold off the Flot call until the container is actually displayed (or use visibility:hidden instead of display:none or move the container off-screen).

(patch by soenter, pull request #1221) Bug fixes Added a work-around to disable the allocation of extra space for first and last axis ticks, allowing plots to span the full width of their container. A proper solution for this bug will be implemented in the 0.9 release. (reported by Josh Pigford and andig, issue #1212, pull request #1290) Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.1, where the last tick label would sometimes wrap rather than extending the plot's offset to create space. (reported by Elite Gamer, issue #1283) Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.2, where the resize plugin would use unexpectedly high amounts of CPU even when idle. (reported by tommie, issue #1277, pull request #1289) Fixed the selection example to work with jQuery 1.9.x and later. (reported by EGLadona and dmfalke, issue #1250, pull request #1285) Added a detach shim to fix support for jQuery versions earlier than 1.4.x. (reported by ngavard, issue #1240, pull request #1286) Fixed a rare 'Uncaught TypeError' when using the resize plugin in IE 7/8. (reported by tleish, issue #1265, pull request #1289) Fixed zoom constraints to apply only in the direction of the zoom. (patch by Neil Katin, issue #1204, pull request #1205) Markings lines are no longer blurry when drawn on pixel boundaries. (reported by btccointicker and Rouillard, issue #1210) Don't discard original pie data-series values when combining slices. (patch by Phil Tsarik, pull request #1238) Fixed broken auto-scale behavior when using deprecated [x|y]2axis options. (reported by jorese, issue #1228, pull request #1284) Exposed the dateGenerator function on the plot object, as it used to be before time-mode was moved into a separate plugin. (patch by Paolo Valleri, pull request #1028) Flot 0.8.2 Changes Added a plot.destroy method as a way to free memory when emptying the plot placeholder and then re-using it for some other purpose. (patch by Thodoris Greasidis, issue #1129, pull request #1130) Added a table of contents and PLUGINS link to the API documentation. (patches by Brian Peiris, pull requests #1064 and #1127) Added Ruby code examples for time conversion. (patch by Mike Po\u0142tyn, pull request #1182) Minor improvements to API.md and README.md. (patches by Patrik Ragnarsson, pull requests #1085 and #1086) Updated inlined jQuery Resize to the latest version to fix errors. (reported by Matthew Sabol and sloker, issues #997 ad #1081) Bug fixes Fixed an unexpected change in behavior that resulted in duplicate tick labels when using a plugin, like flot-tickrotor, that overrode tick labels. (patch by Mark Cote, pull request #1091) Fixed a regression from 0.7 where axis labels were given the wrong width, causing them to overlap at certain scales and ignore the labelWidth option. (patch by Benjamin Gram, pull request #1177) Fixed a bug where the second axis in an xaxes/yaxes array incorrectly had its 'innermost' property set to false or undefined, even if it was on the other side of the plot from the first axis. This resulted in the axis bar being visible when it shouldn't have been, which was especially obvious when the grid had a left/right border width of zero. (reported by Teq1, fix researched by ryleyb, issue #1056) Fixed an error when using a placeholder that has no font-size property. (patch by Craig Oldford, pull request #1135) Fixed a regression from 0.7 where nulls at the end of a series were ignored for purposes of determing the range of the x-axis. (reported by Munsifali Rashid, issue #1095) If a font size is provided, base the default lineHeight on that size rather that the font size of the plot placeholder, which may be very different. (reported by Daniel Hoffmann Bernardes, issue #1131, pull request #1199) Fix broken highlighting for right-aligned bars. (reported by BeWiBu and Mihai Stanciu, issues #975 and #1093, with further assistance by Eric Byers, pull request #1120) Prevent white circles from sometimes showing up inside of pie charts. (reported by Pierre Dubois and Jack Klink, issues #1128 and #1073) Label formatting no longer breaks when a page contains multiple pie charts. (reported by Brend Wanders, issue #1055) When using multiple axes on opposite sides of the plot, the innermost axis coming later in the list no longer has its bar drawn incorrectly. (reported by ryleyb, issue #1056) When removing series labels and redrawing the plot, the legend now updates correctly even when using an external container. (patch by Luis Silva, issue #1159, pull request #1160) The pie plugin no longer ignores the value of the left offset option. (reported by melanker, issue #1136) Fixed a regression from 0.7, where extra padding was added unnecessarily to sides of the plot where there was no last tick label. (reported by sknob001, issue #1048, pull request #1200) Fixed incorrect tooltip behavior in the interacting example.

(patch by Anthony Ryan, pull request #1180) Worked around a browser issue that caused bars to appear un-filled. (reported by irbian, issue #915) Flot 0.8.1 Bug fixes Fixed a regression in the time plugin, introduced in 0.8, that caused dates to align to the minute rather than to the highest appropriate unit. This caused many x-axes in 0.8 to have different ticks than they did in 0.7. (reported by Tom Sheppard, patch by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1017, pull request #1023) Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, that caused axis labels with the same text as another label on the same axis to disappear. More generally, it's again possible to have the same text in two locations. (issue #1032) Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, where axis labels were no longer assigned an explicit width, and their text could not wrap. (reported by sabregreen, issue #1019) Fixed a regression in the pie plugin, introduced in 0.8, that prevented it from accepting data in the format '[[x, y]]'. (patch by Nicolas Morel, pull request #1024) The 'zero' series option and 'autoscale' format option are no longer ignored when the series contains a null value. (reported by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1033) Avoid triggering the time-mode plugin exception when there are zero series. (reported by Daniel Rothig, patch by Mark Raymond, issue #1016) When a custom color palette has fewer colors than the default palette, Flot no longer fills out the colors with the remainder of the default. (patch by goorpy, issue #1031, pull request #1034) Fixed missing update for bar highlights after a zoom or other redraw. (reported by Paolo Valleri, issue #1030) Fixed compatibility with jQuery versions earlier than 1.7. (patch by Lee Willis, issue #1027, pull request #1027) The mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page when using the navigate plugin. (patch by vird, pull request #1020) Fixed missing semicolons in the core library. (reported by Michal Zglinski) Flot 0.8.0 API changes Support for time series has been moved into a plugin, jquery.flot.time.js. This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540). Changes Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting. (patch by risicle, issue 49) Date/time formatting follows proper subset of strftime specifiers, and support added for Date.prototype.strftime, if found. (patch by Mark Cote, issues 419 and 558) Fixed display of year ticks. (patch by Mark Cote, issue 195) Support for time series moved to plugin. (patch by Mark Cote) Display time series in different time zones. (patch by Knut Forkalsrud, issue 141) Added a canvas plugin to enable rendering axis tick labels to the canvas. (sponsored by YCharts.com, implementation by Ole Laursen and David Schnur) Support for setting the interval between redraws of the overlay canvas with redrawOverlayInterval. (suggested in issue 185) Support for multiple thresholds in thresholds plugin. (patch by Arnaud Bellec, issue 523) Support for plotting categories/textual data directly with new categories plugin. Tick generators now get the whole axis rather than just min/max. Added processOffset and drawBackground hooks. (suggested in issue 639) Added a grid \"margin\" option to set the space between the canvas edge and the grid. Prevent the pie example page from generating single-slice pies. (patch by Shane Reustle) In addition to \"left\" and \"center\", bars now recognize \"right\" as an alignment option. (patch by Michael Mayer, issue 520) Switched from toFixed to a much faster default tickFormatter. (patch by Clemens Stolle) Added to a more helpful error when using a time-mode axis without including the flot.time plugin. (patch by Yael Elmatad) Added a legend \"sorted\" option to control sorting of legend entries independent of their series order. (patch by Tom Cleaveland) Added a series \"highlightColor\" option to control the color of the translucent overlay that identifies the dataset when the mouse hovers over it. (patch by Eric Wendelin and Nate Abele, issues 168 and 299) Added a plugin jquery.flot.errorbars, with an accompanying example, that adds the ability to plot error bars, commonly used in many kinds of statistical data visualizations. (patch by Rui Pereira, issue 215) The legend now omits entries whose labelFormatter returns null. (patch by Tom Cleaveland, Christopher Lambert, and Simon Strandgaard) Added support for high pixel density (retina) displays, resulting in much crisper charts on such devices.

(patch by Nick Campbell, pull request #852) Added a new option called 'zero' to bars and filled lines series, to control whether the y-axis minimum is scaled to fit the data or set to zero. (patch by David Schnur, issues #316, #529, and #856, pull request #911) The plot function is now also a jQuery chainable property. (patch by David Schnur, issues #734 and #816, pull request #953) When only a single pie slice is beneath the combine threshold it is no longer replaced by an 'other' slice.

(reported by djamshed, issue #987) Fixed recalculation of tickSize and tickDecimals on calls to setupGrid. (patch by thecountofzero, pull request #861, issues #860, #1000) Flot 0.7 API changes Multiple axes support. Code using dual axes should be changed from using x2axis/y2axis in the options to using an array (although backwards- compatibility hooks are in place). For instance, { xaxis : { ... }, x2axis : { ... }, yaxis : { ... }, y2axis : { ... } } becomes { xaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ], yaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ] } Note that if you're just using one axis, continue to use the xaxis/yaxis directly (it now sets the default settings for the arrays). Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra axes into account, check the source to see some examples. A related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected. So if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in the chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly. \"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a corresponding option on the axes, so: { grid : { tickColor : \"#000\" }} becomes { xaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" }, yaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" } } But if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a tick color by adding transparency. Backwards-compatibility hooks are in place. Final note: now that IE 9 is coming out with canvas support, you may want to adapt the excanvas include to skip loading it in IE 9 (the examples have been adapted thanks to Ryley Breiddal). An alternative to excanvas using Flash has also surfaced, if your graphs are slow in IE, you may want to give it a spin: http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/ Changes Support for specifying a bottom for each point for line charts when filling them, this means that an arbitrary bottom can be used instead of just the x axis. (based on patches patiently provided by Roman V. Prikhodchenko) New fillbetween plugin that can compute a bottom for a series from another series, useful for filling areas between lines. See new example percentiles.html for a use case. More predictable handling of gaps for the stacking plugin, now all undefined ranges are skipped. Stacking plugin can stack horizontal bar charts. Navigate plugin now redraws the plot while panning instead of only after the fact. (raised by lastthemy, issue 235) Can be disabled by setting the pan.frameRate option to null. Date formatter now accepts %0m and %0d to get a zero-padded month or day. (issue raised by Maximillian Dornseif) Revamped internals to support an unlimited number of axes, not just dual. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) New setting on axes, \"tickLength\", to control the size of ticks or turn them off without turning off the labels. Axis labels are now put in container divs with classes, for instance labels in the x axes can be reached via \".xAxis .tickLabel\". Support for setting the color of an axis. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Tick color is now auto-generated as the base color with some transparency, unless you override it. Support for aligning ticks in the axes with \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to ensure that they appear next to each other rather than in between, at the expense of possibly awkward tick steps. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Support for customizing the point type through a callback when plotting points and new symbol plugin with some predefined point types. (sponsored by Utility Data Corporation) Resize plugin for automatically redrawing when the placeholder changes size, e.g. on window resizes. (sponsored by Novus Partners) A resize() method has been added to plot object facilitate this. Support Infinity/-Infinity for plotting asymptotes by hacking it into +/-Number.MAX_VALUE. (reported by rabaea.mircea) Support for restricting navigate plugin to not pan/zoom an axis. (based on patch by kkaefer) Support for providing the drag cursor for the navigate plugin as an option. (based on patch by Kelly T. Moore) Options for controlling whether an axis is shown or not (suggestion by Timo Tuominen) and whether to reserve space for it even if it isn't shown. New attribute $.plot.version with the Flot version as a string. The version comment is now included in the minified jquery.flot.min.js. New options.grid.minBorderMargin for adjusting the minimum margin provided around the border (based on patch by corani, issue 188). Refactor replot behaviour so Flot tries to reuse the existing canvas, adding shutdown() methods to the plot. (based on patch by Ryley Breiddal, issue 269) This prevents a memory leak in Chrome and hopefully makes replotting faster for those who are using $.plot instead of .setData()/.draw(). Also update jQuery to 1.5.1 to prevent IE leaks fixed in jQuery. New real-time line chart example. New hooks: drawSeries, shutdown. Bug fixes Fixed problem with findNearbyItem and bars on top of each other. (reported by ragingchikn, issue 242) Fixed problem with ticks and the border. (based on patch from ultimatehustler69, issue 236) Fixed problem with plugins adding options to the series objects. Fixed a problem introduced in 0.6 with specifying a gradient with: {brightness: x, opacity: y } Don't use $.browser.msie, check for getContext on the created canvas element instead and try to use excanvas if it's not found. Fixes IE 9 compatibility. highlight(s, index) was looking up the point in the original s.data instead of in the computed datapoints array, which breaks with plugins that modify the datapoints, such as the stacking plugin.

Fix bug with tooltip in interacting.html, this makes the tooltip much smoother (fix by bdkahn). Fix related bug inside highlighting handler in Flot. Use closure trick to make inline colorhelpers plugin respect jQuery.noConflict(true), renaming the global jQuery object (reported by Nick Stielau). Listen for mouseleave events and fire a plothover event with empty item when it occurs to drop highlights when the mouse leaves the plot (reported by by outspirit). Fix bug with using aboveData with a background (reported by amitayd). Fix possible excanvas leak (report and suggested fix by tom9729). Fix bug with backwards compatibility for shadowSize = 0 (report and suggested fix by aspinak). Adapt examples to skip loading excanvas (fix by Ryley Breiddal). Fix bug that prevent a simple f(x) = -x transform from working correctly (fix by Mike, issue 263). Fix bug in restoring cursor in navigate plugin (reported by Matteo Gattanini, issue 395). Fix bug in picking items when transform/inverseTransform is in use (reported by Ofri Raviv, and patches and analysis by Jan and Tom Paton, issue 334 and 467). Fix problem with unaligned ticks and hover/click events caused by padding on the placeholder by hardcoding the placeholder padding to 0 (reported by adityadineshsaxena, Matt Sommer, Daniel Atos and some other people, issue 301). Update colorhelpers plugin to avoid dying when trying to parse an invalid string (reported by cadavor, issue 483). Flot 0.6 API changes Selection support has been moved to a plugin. Thus if you're passing selection: { mode: something }, you MUST include the file jquery.flot.selection.js after jquery.flot.js. This reduces the size of base Flot and makes it easier to customize the selection as well as improving code clarity. The change is based on a patch from andershol. In the global options specified in the $.plot command, \"lines\", \"points\", \"bars\" and \"shadowSize\" have been moved to a sub-object called \"series\": $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { lines : { show : true }}) should be changed to $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { series : { lines : { show : true }}}) All future series-specific options will go into this sub-object to simplify plugin writing. Backward-compatibility code is in place, so old code should not break. \"plothover\" no longer provides the original data point, but instead a normalized one, since there may be no corresponding original point. Due to a bug in previous versions of jQuery, you now need at least jQuery 1.2.6. But if you can, try jQuery 1.3.2 as it got some improvements in event handling speed. Changes Added support for disabling interactivity for specific data series. (request from Ronald Schouten and Steve Upton) Flot now calls $() on the placeholder and optional legend container passed in so you can specify DOM elements or CSS expressions to make it easier to use Flot with libraries like Prototype or Mootools or through raw JSON from Ajax responses. A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making a selection. The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most 10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if you're doing something really expensive on this event. The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even replaced. Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid. (patches from Amaury Chamayou and Mike R. Williamson) Added support for gradient backgrounds for the grid. (based on patch from Amaury Chamayou, issue 90) The \"setting options\" example provides a demonstration. Gradient bars. (suggestion by stefpet) Added a \"plotunselected\" event which is triggered when the selection is removed, see \"selection\" example. (suggestion by Meda Ugo) The option legend.margin can now specify horizontal and vertical margins independently. (suggestion by someone who's annoyed) Data passed into Flot is now copied to a new canonical format to enable further processing before it hits the drawing routines. As a side-effect, this should make Flot more robust in the face of bad data. (issue 112) Step-wise charting: line charts have a new option \"steps\" that when set to true connects the points with horizontal/vertical steps instead of diagonal lines. The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just the label. (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier) Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun). Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked bars. New option to disable the (grid.show). Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an offset within the placeholder. Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to internal state. Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some hooks are defined, more are likely to come. Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines. Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use). Image plugin: plot prerendered images. Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot. More configurable grid. Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends). Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge). The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin. It's included inline in the Flot source to make dependency managing easier. This also makes it really easy to use the color helpers in Flot plugins. Bug fixes Fixed two corner-case bugs when drawing filled curves. (report and analysis by Joshua Varner) Fix auto-adjustment code when setting min to 0 for an axis where the dataset is completely flat on that axis. (report by chovy) Fixed a bug with passing in data from getData to setData when the secondary axes are used. (reported by nperelman, issue 65) Fixed so that it is possible to turn lines off when no other chart type is shown (based on problem reported by Glenn Vanderburg), and fixed so that setting lineWidth to 0 also hides the shadow. (based on problem reported by Sergio Nunes) Updated mousemove position expression to the latest from jQuery. (reported by meyuchas) Use CSS borders instead of background in legend. (issues 25 and 45) Explicitly convert axis min/max to numbers. Fixed a bug with drawing marking lines with different colors. (reported by Khurram) Fixed a bug with returning y2 values in the selection event. (fix by exists, issue 75) Only set position relative on placeholder if it hasn't already a position different from static. (reported by kyberneticist, issue 95) Don't round markings to prevent sub-pixel problems. (reported by Dan Lipsitt) Make the grid border act similarly to a regular CSS border, i.e. prevent it from overlapping the plot itself. This also fixes a problem with anti- aliasing when the width is 1 pixel. (reported by Anthony Ettinger) Imported version 3 of excanvas and fixed two issues with the newer version. Hopefully, this will make Flot work with IE8. (nudge by Fabien Menager, further analysis by Booink, issue 133) Changed the shadow code for lines to hopefully look a bit better with vertical lines. Round tick positions to avoid possible problems with fractions. (suggestion by Fred, issue 130) Made the heuristic for determining how many ticks to aim for a bit smarter. Fix for uneven axis margins (report and patch by Paul Kienzle) and snapping to ticks. (report and patch by lifthrasiir) Fixed bug with slicing in findNearbyItems. (patch by zollman) Make heuristic for x axis label widths more dynamic. (patch by rickinhethuis) Make sure points on top take precedence when finding nearby points when hovering. (reported by didroe, issue 224) Flot 0.5 Timestamps are now in UTC. Also \"selected\" event -> becomes \"plotselected\" with new data, the parameters for setSelection are now different (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place), coloredAreas becomes markings with a new interface (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place). API changes Timestamps in time mode are now displayed according to UTC instead of the time zone of the visitor. This affects the way the timestamps should be input; you'll probably have to offset the timestamps according to your local time zone. It also affects any custom date handling code (which basically now should use the equivalent UTC date mehods, e.g. .setUTCMonth() instead of .setMonth(). Markings, previously coloredAreas, are now specified as ranges on the axes, like { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }} . Furthermore with markings you can now draw horizontal/vertical lines by setting from and to to the same coordinate. (idea from line support patch by by Ryan Funduk) Interactivity: added a new \"plothover\" event and this and the \"plotclick\" event now returns the closest data item (based on patch by /david, patch by Mark Byers for bar support). See the revamped \"interacting with the data\" example for some hints on what you can do. Highlighting: you can now highlight points and datapoints are autohighlighted when you hover over them (if hovering is turned on). Support for dual axis has been added (based on patch by someone who's annoyed and /david). For each data series you can specify which axes it belongs to, and there are two more axes, x2axis and y2axis, to customize. This affects the \"selected\" event which has been renamed to \"plotselected\" and spews out { xaxis: { from: -10, to: 20 } ... }, setSelection in which the parameters are on a new form (backwards compatible hooks are in place so old code shouldn't break) and markings (formerly coloredAreas). Changes Added support for specifying the size of tick labels (axis.labelWidth, axis.labelHeight). Useful for specifying a max label size to keep multiple plots aligned. The \"fill\" option can now be a number that specifies the opacity of the fill. You can now specify a coordinate as null (like [2, null]) and Flot will take the other coordinate into account when scaling the axes. (based on patch by joebno) New option for bars \"align\". Set it to \"center\" to center the bars on the value they represent. setSelection now takes a second parameter which you can use to prevent the method from firing the \"plotselected\" handler. Improved the handling of axis auto-scaling with bars. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in calculating spacing around the plot. (reported by timothytoe) Fixed a bug in finding max values for all-negative data sets. Prevent the possibility of eternal looping in tick calculations. Fixed a bug when borderWidth is set to 0. (reported by Rob/sanchothefat) Fixed a bug with drawing bars extending below 0. (reported by James Hewitt, patch by Ryan Funduk). Fixed a bug with line widths of bars. (reported by MikeM) Fixed a bug with 'nw' and 'sw' legend positions. Fixed a bug with multi-line x-axis tick labels. (reported by Luca Ciano, IE-fix help by Savage Zhang) Using the \"container\" option in legend now overwrites the container element instead of just appending to it, fixing the infinite legend bug. (reported by several people, fix by Brad Dewey) Flot 0.4 API changes Deprecated axis.noTicks in favor of just specifying the number as axis.ticks. So xaxis: { noTicks: 10 } becomes xaxis: { ticks: 10 } . Time series support. Specify axis.mode: \"time\", put in Javascript timestamps as data, and Flot will automatically spit out sensible ticks. Take a look at the two new examples. The format can be customized with axis.timeformat and axis.monthNames, or if that fails with axis.tickFormatter. Support for colored background areas via grid.coloredAreas. Specify an array of { x1, y1, x2, y2 } objects or a function that returns these given { xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax }. More members on the plot object (report by Chris Davies and others). \"getData\" for inspecting the assigned settings on data series (e.g. color) and \"setData\", \"setupGrid\" and \"draw\" for updating the contents without a total replot. The default number of ticks to aim for is now dependent on the size of the plot in pixels. Support for customizing tick interval sizes directly with axis.minTickSize and axis.tickSize. Cleaned up the automatic axis scaling algorithm and fixed how it interacts with ticks. Also fixed a couple of tick-related corner case bugs (one reported by mainstreetmark, another reported by timothytoe). The option axis.tickFormatter now takes a function with two parameters, the second parameter is an optional object with information about the axis. It has min, max, tickDecimals, tickSize. Changes Added support for segmented lines. (based on patch from Michael MacDonald) Added support for ignoring null and bad values. (suggestion from Nick Konidaris and joshwaihi) Added support for changing the border width. (thanks to joebno and safoo) Label colors can be changed via CSS by selecting the tickLabel class. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in handling single-item bar series. (reported by Emil Filipov) Fixed erratic behaviour when interacting with the plot with IE 7. (reported by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Prevent IE/Safari text selection when selecting stuff on the canvas. Flot 0.3 This is mostly a quick-fix release because jquery.js wasn't included in the previous zip/tarball. Changes Include jquery.js in the zip/tarball. Support clicking on the plot. Turn it on with grid: { clickable: true }, then you get a \"plotclick\" event on the graph placeholder with the position in units of the plot. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in dealing with data where min = max. (thanks to Michael Messinides) Flot 0.2 The API should now be fully documented. API changes Moved labelMargin option to grid from x/yaxis. Changes Added support for putting a background behind the default legend. The default is the partly transparent background color. Added backgroundColor and backgroundOpacity to the legend options to control this. The ticks options can now be a callback function that takes one parameter, an object with the attributes min and max. The function should return a ticks array. Added labelFormatter option in legend, useful for turning the legend labels into links. Reduced the size of the code.

This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540).","title":"API changes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/NEWS/#changes_2","text":"Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting.

Code using dual axes should be changed from using x2axis/y2axis in the options to using an array (although backwards- compatibility hooks are in place). For instance, { xaxis : { ... }, x2axis : { ... }, yaxis : { ... }, y2axis : { ... } } becomes { xaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ], yaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ] } Note that if you're just using one axis, continue to use the xaxis/yaxis directly (it now sets the default settings for the arrays). Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra axes into account, check the source to see some examples. A related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected. So if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in the chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly. \"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a corresponding option on the axes, so: { grid : { tickColor : \"#000\" }} becomes { xaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" }, yaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" } } But if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a tick color by adding transparency. Backwards-compatibility hooks are in place. Final note: now that IE 9 is coming out with canvas support, you may want to adapt the excanvas include to skip loading it in IE 9 (the examples have been adapted thanks to Ryley Breiddal).

A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making a selection. The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most 10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if you're doing something really expensive on this event. The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even replaced. Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid.

The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just the label. (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier) Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun). Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked bars. New option to disable the (grid.show). Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an offset within the placeholder. Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to internal state. Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some hooks are defined, more are likely to come. Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines. Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use). Image plugin: plot prerendered images. Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot. More configurable grid. Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends). Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge). The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin.

For example: function myCoolPluginInit ( plot ) { plot . coolstring = \"Hello!\" ; }; $ . plot . plugins . push ({ init : myCoolPluginInit , options : { ... } }); // if $.plot is called, it will return a plot object with the // attribute \"coolstring\" Now, given that the plugin might run in many different places, it's a good idea to avoid leaking names. The usual trick here is wrap the above lines in an anonymous function which is called immediately, like this: (function () { inner code ... })(). To make it even more robust in case $ is not bound to jQuery but some other Javascript library, we can write it as ( function ( $ ) { // plugin definition // ... })( jQuery ); There's a complete example below, but you should also check out the plugins bundled with Flot. Complete example Here is a simple debug plugin which alerts each of the series in the plot. It has a single option that control whether it is enabled and how much info to output: ( function ( $ ) { function init ( plot ) { var debugLevel = 1 ; function checkDebugEnabled ( plot , options ) { if ( options . debug ) { debugLevel = options . debug ; plot . hooks . processDatapoints . push ( alertSeries ); } } function alertSeries ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var msg = \"series \" + series . label ; if ( debugLevel > 1 ) { msg += \" with \" + series . data . length + \" points\" ; alert ( msg ); } } plot . hooks . processOptions . push ( checkDebugEnabled ); } var options = { debug : 0 }; $ . plot . plugins . push ({ init : init , options : options , name : \"simpledebug\" , version : \"0.1\" }); })( jQuery ); We also define \"name\" and \"version\". It's not used by Flot, but might be helpful for other plugins in resolving dependencies. Put the above in a file named \"jquery.flot.debug.js\", include it in an HTML page and then it can be used with: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [...], { debug : 2 }); This simple plugin illustrates a couple of points: It uses the anonymous function trick to avoid name pollution. It can be enabled/disabled through an option. Variables in the init function can be used to store plot-specific state between the hooks. The two last points are important because there may be multiple plots on the same page, and you'd want to make sure they are not mixed up. Shutting down a plugin Each plot object has a shutdown hook which is run when plot.shutdown() is called. This usually mostly happens in case another plot is made on top of an existing one. The purpose of the hook is to give you a chance to unbind any event handlers you've registered and remove any extra DOM things you've inserted. The problem with event handlers is that you can have registered a handler which is run in some point in the future, e.g. with setTimeout(). Meanwhile, the plot may have been shutdown and removed, but because your event handler is still referencing it, it can't be garbage collected yet, and worse, if your handler eventually runs, it may overwrite stuff on a completely different plot. Some hints on the options Plugins should always support appropriate options to enable/disable them because the plugin user may have several plots on the same page where only one should use the plugin. In most cases it's probably a good idea if the plugin is turned off rather than on per default, just like most of the powerful features in Flot. If the plugin needs options that are specific to each series, like the points or lines options in core Flot, you can put them in \"series\" in the options object, e.g. var options = { series : { downsample : { algorithm : null , maxpoints : 1000 } } } Then they will be copied by Flot into each series, providing default values in case none are specified. Think hard and long about naming the options. These names are going to be public API, and code is going to depend on them if the plugin is successful.","title":"PLUGINS"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/PLUGINS/#writing-plugins","text":"All you need to do to make a new plugin is creating an init function and a set of options (if needed), stuffing it into an object and putting it in the $.plot.plugins array.

To make it even more robust in case $ is not bound to jQuery but some other Javascript library, we can write it as ( function ( $ ) { // plugin definition // ... })( jQuery ); There's a complete example below, but you should also check out the plugins bundled with Flot.","title":"Writing plugins"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/PLUGINS/#complete-example","text":"Here is a simple debug plugin which alerts each of the series in the plot. It has a single option that control whether it is enabled and how much info to output: ( function ( $ ) { function init ( plot ) { var debugLevel = 1 ; function checkDebugEnabled ( plot , options ) { if ( options . debug ) { debugLevel = options . debug ; plot . hooks . processDatapoints . push ( alertSeries ); } } function alertSeries ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var msg = \"series \" + series . label ; if ( debugLevel > 1 ) { msg += \" with \" + series . data . length + \" points\" ; alert ( msg ); } } plot . hooks . processOptions . push ( checkDebugEnabled ); } var options = { debug : 0 }; $ . plot . plugins . push ({ init : init , options : options , name : \"simpledebug\" , version : \"0.1\" }); })( jQuery ); We also define \"name\" and \"version\". It's not used by Flot, but might be helpful for other plugins in resolving dependencies. Put the above in a file named \"jquery.flot.debug.js\", include it in an HTML page and then it can be used with: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [...], { debug : 2 }); This simple plugin illustrates a couple of points: It uses the anonymous function trick to avoid name pollution. It can be enabled/disabled through an option. Variables in the init function can be used to store plot-specific state between the hooks. The two last points are important because there may be multiple plots on the same page, and you'd want to make sure they are not mixed up.","title":"Complete example"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/PLUGINS/#shutting-down-a-plugin","text":"Each plot object has a shutdown hook which is run when plot.shutdown() is called. This usually mostly happens in case another plot is made on top of an existing one. The purpose of the hook is to give you a chance to unbind any event handlers you've registered and remove any extra DOM things you've inserted. The problem with event handlers is that you can have registered a handler which is run in some point in the future, e.g. with setTimeout(). Meanwhile, the plot may have been shutdown and removed, but because your event handler is still referencing it, it can't be garbage collected yet, and worse, if your handler eventually runs, it may overwrite stuff on a completely different plot.","title":"Shutting down a plugin"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/PLUGINS/#some-hints-on-the-options","text":"Plugins should always support appropriate options to enable/disable them because the plugin user may have several plots on the same page where only one should use the plugin. In most cases it's probably a good idea if the plugin is turned off rather than on per default, just like most of the powerful features in Flot. If the plugin needs options that are specific to each series, like the points or lines options in core Flot, you can put them in \"series\" in the options object, e.g. var options = { series : { downsample : { algorithm : null , maxpoints : 1000 } } } Then they will be copied by Flot into each series, providing default values in case none are specified. Think hard and long about naming the options. These names are going to be public API, and code is going to depend on them if the plugin is successful.","title":"Some hints on the options"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t3-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot-axislabels/","text":"============================================ Originally written by Xuan Luo. Maintained by Mark Cote. Contributions: Xuan Luo Mark Cote stdexcept Clemens Stolle Michael Haddon andig Alex Pinkney flot-axislabels provides flot with the ability to label axes. It supports any number of axes. It can render the labels with CSS transforms, in canvas, or with traditional CSS positioning (\"HTML\" mode). flot-axislabels attempts a graceful fallback from CSS to canvas to HTML if some modes are not supported. You can also force a particular lesser mode (canvas or HTML). In both CSS and canvas modes, the y-axis labels are rotated to face the graph (90 degrees counter-clockwise for left-hand labels, and 90 degrees clockwise for right-hand labels). In HTML mode, y-axis labels are left horizontal (warning: this takes up a lot of space). In CSS and HTML modes, each axis label belongs to the classes \"axisLabels\" and \"[axisName]Label\" (e.g. .xaxisLabel, .y2axisLabel, etc). You can use standard CSS properties to customize their appearance. In canvas mode, you can set font size, family, and colour through flot options (see below). Example $(function () { var options = { axisLabels: { show: true }, xaxes: [{ axisLabel: 'foo', }], yaxes: [{ position: 'left', axisLabel: 'bar', }, { position: 'right', axisLabel: 'bleem' }] }; $.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), yourData, options); ); }); Usage flot-axislabel adds an axisLabels object to the global options object. It supports one option: show (bool): display all axis labels (default: true) There are also several options added to the axis objects. The two main ones are axisLabel (string): the text you want displayed as the label axisLabelPadding (int): padding, in pixels, between the tick labels and the axis label (default: 2) By default, if supported, flot-axislabels uses CSS transforms. You can force either canvas or HTML mode by setting axisLabelUseCanvas or axisLabelUseHtml, respectively, to true. Canvas mode supports several other options: axisLabelFontSizePixels (int): the size, in pixels, of the font (default: 14) axisLabelFontFamily (string): the font family of the font (default: sans-serif) axisLabelColour (string): the font colour (default: black) Compatibility flot-axislabels should work with recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. It also works with IE 8 and 9. The canvas option does not seem to work with IE 8, even with excanvas.

Read more at the website: http://www.flotcharts.org/ Take a look at the the examples in examples/index.html; they should give a good impression of what Flot can do, and the source code of the examples is probably the fastest way to learn how to use Flot. Installation Just include the Javascript file after you've included jQuery. Generally, all browsers that support the HTML5 canvas tag are supported. For support for Internet Explorer < 9, you can use Excanvas , a canvas emulator; this is used in the examples bundled with Flot. You just include the excanvas script like this: <!--[if lte IE 8]><script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"excanvas.min.js\"></script><![endif]--> If it's not working on your development IE 6.0, check that it has support for VML which Excanvas is relying on. It appears that some stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines lack the VML support. You can also try using Flashcanvas , which uses Flash to do the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML, if you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster overall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which Flashcanvas is compatible with. You need at least jQuery 1.2.6, but try at least 1.3.2 for interactive charts because of performance improvements in event handling. Basic usage Create a placeholder div to put the graph in: < div id = \"placeholder\" ></ div > You need to set the width and height of this div, otherwise the plot library doesn't know how to scale the graph. You can do it inline like this: < div id = \"placeholder\" style = \"width:600px;height:300px\" ></ div > You can also do it with an external stylesheet. Make sure that the placeholder isn't within something with a display:none CSS property - in that case, Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which results in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the placeholder dimensions which is fatal (it'll throw an exception). Then when the div is ready in the DOM, which is usually on document ready, run the plot function: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), data , options ); Here, data is an array of data series and options is an object with settings if you want to customize the plot. Take a look at the examples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the API reference .

It appears that some stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines lack the VML support. You can also try using Flashcanvas , which uses Flash to do the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML, if you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster overall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which Flashcanvas is compatible with.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below. Note that in general Flot gives no guarantees if you change any of the objects you pass in to the plot function or get out of it since they're not necessarily deep-copied. Data Format The data is an array of data series: [ series1 , series2 , ... ] A series can either be raw data or an object with properties. The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ] Plot Options All options are completely optional. They are documented individually below, to change them you just specify them in an object, e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true }, points : { show : true } } }; $ . plot ( placeholder , data , options ); Customizing the legend legend : { show : boolean labelFormatter : null or ( fn : string , series object -> string ) labelBoxBorderColor : color noColumns : number position : \"ne\" or \"nw\" or \"se\" or \"sw\" margin : number of pixels or [ x margin , y margin ] backgroundColor : null or color backgroundOpacity : number between 0 and 1 container : null or jQuery object / DOM element / jQuery expression sorted : null / false , true , \"ascending\" , \"descending\" , \"reverse\" , or a comparator } The legend is generated as a table with the data series labels and small label boxes with the color of the series. If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) } Customizing the axes xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places. Multiple axes If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\". Time series data Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between. Customizing the data series series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme. Customizing the grid grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device). The default is capped to 60 frames per second. You can set it to -1 to disable the rate limiting. Specifying gradients A gradient is specified like this: { colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] } For instance, you might specify a background on the grid going from black to gray like this: grid : { backgroundColor : { colors : [ \"#000\" , \"#999\" ] } } For the series you can specify the gradient as an object that specifies the scaling of the brightness and the opacity of the series color, e.g. { colors : [{ opacity : 0.8 }, { brightness : 0.6 , opacity : 0.8 } ] } where the first color simply has its alpha scaled, whereas the second is also darkened. For instance, for bars the following makes the bars gradually disappear, without outline: bars : { show : true , lineWidth : 0 , fill : true , fillColor : { colors : [ { opacity : 0.8 }, { opacity : 0.1 } ] } } Flot currently only supports vertical gradients drawn from top to bottom because that's what works with IE. Plot Methods The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you can call: highlight(series, datapoint) Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change. Hooks In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info. Plugins Plugins extend the functionality of Flot. To use a plugin, simply include its Javascript file after Flot in the HTML page. If you're worried about download size/latency, you can concatenate all the plugins you use, and Flot itself for that matter, into one big file (make sure you get the order right), then optionally run it through a Javascript minifier such as YUI Compressor. Here's a brief explanation of how the plugin plumbings work: Each plugin registers itself in the global array $.plot.plugins. When you make a new plot object with $.plot, Flot goes through this array calling the \"init\" function of each plugin and merging default options from the \"option\" attribute of the plugin. The init function gets a reference to the plot object created and uses this to register hooks and add new public methods if needed. See the PLUGINS document for details on how to write a plugin. As the above description hints, it's actually pretty easy.

This placeholder needs to have its width and height set as explained in the README (go read that now if you haven't, it's short). The plot will modify some properties of the placeholder so it's recommended you simply pass in a div that you don't use for anything else. Make sure you check any fancy styling you apply to the div, e.g. background images have been reported to be a problem on IE 7. The plot function can also be used as a jQuery chainable property. This form naturally can't return the plot object directly, but you can still access it via the 'plot' data key, like this: var plot = $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). plot ( data , options ). data ( \"plot\" ); The format of the data is documented below, as is the available options. The plot object returned from the call has some methods you can call. These are documented separately below. Note that in general Flot gives no guarantees if you change any of the objects you pass in to the plot function or get out of it since they're not necessarily deep-copied.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#data-format","text":"The data is an array of data series: [ series1 , series2 , ... ] A series can either be raw data or an object with properties. The raw data format is an array of points: [ [ x1 , y1 ], [ x2 , y2 ], ... ] E.g. [ [ 1 , 3 ], [ 2 , 14.01 ], [ 3.5 , 3.14 ] ] Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. If a null is specified as a point or if one of the coordinates is null or couldn't be converted to a number, the point is ignored when drawing. As a special case, a null value for lines is interpreted as a line segment end, i.e. the points before and after the null value are not connected. Lines and points take two coordinates. For filled lines and bars, you can specify a third coordinate which is the bottom of the filled area/bar (defaults to 0). The format of a single series object is as follows: { color : color or number data : rawdata label : string lines : specific lines options bars : specific bars options points : specific points options xaxis : number yaxis : number clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } You don't have to specify any of them except the data, the rest are options that will get default values. Typically you'd only specify label and data, like this: { label : \"y = 3\" , data : [[ 0 , 3 ], [ 10 , 3 ]] } The label is used for the legend, if you don't specify one, the series will not show up in the legend. If you don't specify color, the series will get a color from the auto-generated colors. The color is either a CSS color specification (like \"rgb(255, 100, 123)\") or an integer that specifies which of auto-generated colors to select, e.g. 0 will get color no. 0, etc. The latter is mostly useful if you let the user add and remove series, in which case you can hard-code the color index to prevent the colors from jumping around between the series. The \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\" options specify which axis to use. The axes are numbered from 1 (default), so { yaxis: 2} means that the series should be plotted against the second y axis. \"clickable\" and \"hoverable\" can be set to false to disable interactivity for specific series if interactivity is turned on in the plot, see below. The rest of the options are all documented below as they are the same as the default options passed in via the options parameter in the plot commmand. When you specify them for a specific data series, they will override the default options for the plot for that data series. Here's a complete example of a simple data specification: [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [ [ 10 , 1 ], [ 17 , - 14 ], [ 30 , 5 ] ] }, { label : \"Bar\" , data : [ [ 11 , 13 ], [ 19 , 11 ], [ 30 , - 7 ] ] } ]","title":"Data Format"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plot-options","text":"All options are completely optional.

If you want to format the labels in some way, e.g. make them to links, you can pass in a function for \"labelFormatter\". Here's an example that makes them clickable: labelFormatter : function ( label , series ) { // series is the series object for the label return '<a href=\"#' + label + '\">' + label + '</a>' ; } To prevent a series from showing up in the legend, simply have the function return null. \"noColumns\" is the number of columns to divide the legend table into. \"position\" specifies the overall placement of the legend within the plot (top-right, top-left, etc.) and margin the distance to the plot edge (this can be either a number or an array of two numbers like [x, y]). \"backgroundColor\" and \"backgroundOpacity\" specifies the background. The default is a partly transparent auto-detected background. If you want the legend to appear somewhere else in the DOM, you can specify \"container\" as a jQuery object/expression to put the legend table into. The \"position\" and \"margin\" etc. options will then be ignored. Note that Flot will overwrite the contents of the container. Legend entries appear in the same order as their series by default. If \"sorted\" is \"reverse\" then they appear in the opposite order from their series. To sort them alphabetically, you can specify true, \"ascending\" or \"descending\", where true and \"ascending\" are equivalent. You can also provide your own comparator function that accepts two objects with \"label\" and \"color\" properties, and returns zero if they are equal, a positive value if the first is greater than the second, and a negative value if the first is less than the second. sorted : function ( a , b ) { // sort alphabetically in ascending order return a . label == b . label ? 0 : ( a . label > b . label ? 1 : - 1 ) }","title":"Customizing the legend"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-axes","text":"xaxis , yaxis : { show : null or true / false position : \"bottom\" or \"top\" or \"left\" or \"right\" mode : null or \"time\" ( \"time\" requires jquery . flot . time . js plugin ) timezone : null , \"browser\" or timezone ( only makes sense for mode : \"time\" ) color : null or color spec tickColor : null or color spec font : null or font spec object min : null or number max : null or number autoscaleMargin : null or number transform : null or fn : number -> number inverseTransform : null or fn : number -> number ticks : null or number or ticks array or ( fn : axis -> ticks array ) tickSize : number or array minTickSize : number or array tickFormatter : ( fn : number , object -> string ) or string tickDecimals : null or number labelWidth : null or number labelHeight : null or number reserveSpace : null or true tickLength : null or number alignTicksWithAxis : null or number } All axes have the same kind of options. The following describes how to configure one axis, see below for what to do if you've got more than one x axis or y axis. If you don't set the \"show\" option (i.e. it is null), visibility is auto-detected, i.e. the axis will show up if there's data associated with it. You can override this by setting the \"show\" option to true or false. The \"position\" option specifies where the axis is placed, bottom or top for x axes, left or right for y axes. The \"mode\" option determines how the data is interpreted, the default of null means as decimal numbers. Use \"time\" for time series data; see the time series data section. The time plugin (jquery.flot.time.js) is required for time series support. The \"color\" option determines the color of the line and ticks for the axis, and defaults to the grid color with transparency. For more fine-grained control you can also set the color of the ticks separately with \"tickColor\". You can customize the font and color used to draw the axis tick labels with CSS or directly via the \"font\" option. When \"font\" is null - the default - each tick label is given the 'flot-tick-label' class. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier the labels are also given the 'tickLabel' class, but this is deprecated and scheduled to be removed with the release of version 1.0.0. To enable more granular control over styles, labels are divided between a set of text containers, with each holding the labels for one axis. These containers are given the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis', and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis', where '#' is the number of the axis when there are multiple axes. For example, the x-axis labels for a simple plot with only a single x-axis might look like this: < div class = 'flot-x-axis flot-x1-axis' > < div class = 'flot-tick-label' > January 2013 </ div > ... </ div > For direct control over label styles you can also provide \"font\" as an object with this format: { size : 11 , lineHeight : 13 , style : \"italic\" , weight : \"bold\" , family : \"sans-serif\" , variant : \"small-caps\" , color : \"#545454\" } The size and lineHeight must be expressed in pixels; CSS units such as 'em' or 'smaller' are not allowed. The options \"min\"/\"max\" are the precise minimum/maximum value on the scale. If you don't specify either of them, a value will automatically be chosen based on the minimum/maximum data values. Note that Flot always examines all the data values you feed to it, even if a restriction on another axis may make some of them invisible (this makes interactive use more stable). The \"autoscaleMargin\" is a bit esoteric: it's the fraction of margin that the scaling algorithm will add to avoid that the outermost points ends up on the grid border. Note that this margin is only applied when a min or max value is not explicitly set. If a margin is specified, the plot will furthermore extend the axis end-point to the nearest whole tick. The default value is \"null\" for the x axes and 0.02 for y axes which seems appropriate for most cases. \"transform\" and \"inverseTransform\" are callbacks you can put in to change the way the data is drawn. You can design a function to compress or expand certain parts of the axis non-linearly, e.g. suppress weekends or compress far away points with a logarithm or some other means. When Flot draws the plot, each value is first put through the transform function. Here's an example, the x axis can be turned into a natural logarithm axis with the following code: xaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return Math . log ( v ); }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return Math . exp ( v ); } } Similarly, for reversing the y axis so the values appear in inverse order: yaxis : { transform : function ( v ) { return - v ; }, inverseTransform : function ( v ) { return - v ; } } Note that for finding extrema, Flot assumes that the transform function does not reorder values (it should be monotone). The inverseTransform is simply the inverse of the transform function (so v == inverseTransform(transform(v)) for all relevant v). It is required for converting from canvas coordinates to data coordinates, e.g. for a mouse interaction where a certain pixel is clicked. If you don't use any interactive features of Flot, you may not need it. The rest of the options deal with the ticks. If you don't specify any ticks, a tick generator algorithm will make some for you. The algorithm has two passes. It first estimates how many ticks would be reasonable and uses this number to compute a nice round tick interval size. Then it generates the ticks. You can specify how many ticks the algorithm aims for by setting \"ticks\" to a number. The algorithm always tries to generate reasonably round tick values so even if you ask for three ticks, you might get five if that fits better with the rounding. If you don't want any ticks at all, set \"ticks\" to 0 or an empty array. Another option is to skip the rounding part and directly set the tick interval size with \"tickSize\". If you set it to 2, you'll get ticks at 2, 4, 6, etc. Alternatively, you can specify that you just don't want ticks at a size less than a specific tick size with \"minTickSize\". Note that for time series, the format is an array like [2, \"month\"], see the next section. If you want to completely override the tick algorithm, you can specify an array for \"ticks\", either like this: ticks : [ 0 , 1.2 , 2.4 ] Or like this where the labels are also customized: ticks : [[ 0 , \"zero\" ], [ 1.2 , \"one mark\" ], [ 2.4 , \"two marks\" ]] You can mix the two if you like. For extra flexibility you can specify a function as the \"ticks\" parameter. The function will be called with an object with the axis min and max and should return a ticks array. Here's a simplistic tick generator that spits out intervals of pi, suitable for use on the x axis for trigonometric functions: function piTickGenerator ( axis ) { var res = [], i = Math . floor ( axis . min / Math . PI ); do { var v = i * Math . PI ; res . push ([ v , i + \"\\u03c0\" ]); ++ i ; } while ( v < axis . max ); return res ; } You can control how the ticks look like with \"tickDecimals\", the number of decimals to display (default is auto-detected). Alternatively, for ultimate control over how ticks are formatted you can provide a function to \"tickFormatter\". The function is passed two parameters, the tick value and an axis object with information, and should return a string. The default formatter looks like this: function formatter ( val , axis ) { return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ); } The axis object has \"min\" and \"max\" with the range of the axis, \"tickDecimals\" with the number of decimals to round the value to and \"tickSize\" with the size of the interval between ticks as calculated by the automatic axis scaling algorithm (or specified by you). Here's an example of a custom formatter: function suffixFormatter ( val , axis ) { if ( val > 1000000 ) return ( val / 1000000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" MB\" ; else if ( val > 1000 ) return ( val / 1000 ). toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" kB\" ; else return val . toFixed ( axis . tickDecimals ) + \" B\" ; } \"labelWidth\" and \"labelHeight\" specifies a fixed size of the tick labels in pixels. They're useful in case you need to align several plots. \"reserveSpace\" means that even if an axis isn't shown, Flot should reserve space for it - it is useful in combination with labelWidth and labelHeight for aligning multi-axis charts. \"tickLength\" is the length of the tick lines in pixels. By default, the innermost axes will have ticks that extend all across the plot, while any extra axes use small ticks. A value of null means use the default, while a number means small ticks of that length - set it to 0 to hide the lines completely. If you set \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to the number of another axis, e.g. alignTicksWithAxis: 1, Flot will ensure that the autogenerated ticks of this axis are aligned with the ticks of the other axis. This may improve the looks, e.g. if you have one y axis to the left and one to the right, because the grid lines will then match the ticks in both ends. The trade-off is that the forced ticks won't necessarily be at natural places.","title":"Customizing the axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#multiple-axes","text":"If you need more than one x axis or y axis, you need to specify for each data series which axis they are to use, as described under the format of the data series, e.g. { data: [...], yaxis: 2 } specifies that a series should be plotted against the second y axis. To actually configure that axis, you can't use the xaxis/yaxis options directly - instead there are two arrays in the options: xaxes : [] yaxes : [] Here's an example of configuring a single x axis and two y axes (we can leave options of the first y axis empty as the defaults are fine): { xaxes : [ { position : \"top\" } ], yaxes : [ { }, { position : \"right\" , min : 20 } ] } The arrays get their default values from the xaxis/yaxis settings, so say you want to have all y axes start at zero, you can simply specify yaxis: { min: 0 } instead of adding a min parameter to all the axes. Generally, the various interfaces in Flot dealing with data points either accept an xaxis/yaxis parameter to specify which axis number to use (starting from 1), or lets you specify the coordinate directly as x2/x3/... or x2axis/x3axis/... instead of \"x\" or \"xaxis\".","title":"Multiple axes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#time-series-data","text":"Please note that it is now required to include the time plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, for time series support. Time series are a bit more difficult than scalar data because calendars don't follow a simple base 10 system. For many cases, Flot abstracts most of this away, but it can still be a bit difficult to get the data into Flot. So we'll first discuss the data format. The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! You can see a timestamp like this alert (( new Date ()). getTime ()) There are different schools of thought when it comes to display of timestamps. Many will want the timestamps to be displayed according to a certain time zone, usually the time zone in which the data has been produced. Some want the localized experience, where the timestamps are displayed according to the local time of the visitor. Flot supports both. Optionally you can include a third-party library to get additional timezone support. Default behavior is that Flot always displays timestamps according to UTC. The reason being that the core Javascript Date object does not support other fixed time zones. Often your data is at another time zone, so it may take a little bit of tweaking to work around this limitation. The easiest way to think about it is to pretend that the data production time zone is UTC, even if it isn't. So if you have a datapoint at 2002-02-20 08:00, you can generate a timestamp for eight o'clock UTC even if it really happened eight o'clock UTC+0200. In PHP you can get an appropriate timestamp with: strtotime(\"2002-02-20 UTC\") * 1000 In Python you can get it with something like: calendar . timegm ( datetime_object . timetuple ()) * 1000 In Ruby you can get it using the #to_i method on the Time object. If you're using the active_support gem (default for Ruby on Rails applications) #to_i is also available on the DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone objects. You simply need to multiply the result by 1000: Time . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 # ActiveSupport examples: DateTime . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 ActiveSupport :: TimeZone . new ( 'Asia/Shanghai' ) . now . to_i * 1000 # => 1383582043000 In .NET you can get it with something like: public static int GetJavascriptTimestamp(System.DateTime input) { System.TimeSpan span = new System.TimeSpan(System.DateTime.Parse(\"1/1/1970\").Ticks); System.DateTime time = input.Subtract(span); return (long)(time.Ticks / 10000); } Javascript also has some support for parsing date strings, so it is possible to generate the timestamps manually client-side. If you've already got the real UTC timestamp, it's too late to use the pretend trick described above. But you can fix up the timestamps by adding the time zone offset, e.g. for UTC+0200 you would add 2 hours to the UTC timestamp you got. Then it'll look right on the plot. Most programming environments have some means of getting the timezone offset for a specific date (note that you need to get the offset for each individual timestamp to account for daylight savings). The alternative with core Javascript is to interpret the timestamps according to the time zone that the visitor is in, which means that the ticks will shift with the time zone and daylight savings of each visitor. This behavior is enabled by setting the axis option \"timezone\" to the value \"browser\". If you need more time zone functionality than this, there is still another option. If you include the \"timezone-js\" library https://github.com/mde/timezone-js in the page and set axis.timezone to a value recognized by said library, Flot will use timezone-js to interpret the timestamps according to that time zone. Once you've gotten the timestamps into the data and specified \"time\" as the axis mode, Flot will automatically generate relevant ticks and format them. As always, you can tweak the ticks via the \"ticks\" option - just remember that the values should be timestamps (numbers), not Date objects. Tick generation and formatting can also be controlled separately through the following axis options: minTickSize : array timeformat : null or format string monthNames : null or array of size 12 of strings dayNames : null or array of size 7 of strings twelveHourClock : boolean Here \"timeformat\" is a format string to use. You might use it like this: xaxis : { mode : \"time\" , timeformat : \"%Y/%m/%d\" } This will result in tick labels like \"2000/12/24\". A subset of the standard strftime specifiers are supported (plus the nonstandard %q): % a : weekday name ( customizable ) % b : month name ( customizable ) % d : day of month , zero - padded ( 01 - 31 ) % e : day of month , space - padded ( 1 - 31 ) % H : hours , 24 - hour time , zero - padded ( 00 - 23 ) % I : hours , 12 - hour time , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % m : month , zero - padded ( 01 - 12 ) % M : minutes , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % q : quarter ( 1 - 4 ) % S : seconds , zero - padded ( 00 - 59 ) % y : year ( two digits ) % Y : year ( four digits ) % p : am / pm % P : AM / PM ( uppercase version of % p ) % w : weekday as number ( 0 - 6 , 0 being Sunday ) Flot 0.8 switched from %h to the standard %H hours specifier. The %h specifier is still available, for backwards-compatibility, but is deprecated and scheduled to be removed permanently with the release of version 1.0. You can customize the month names with the \"monthNames\" option. For instance, for Danish you might specify: monthNames : [ \"jan\" , \"feb\" , \"mar\" , \"apr\" , \"maj\" , \"jun\" , \"jul\" , \"aug\" , \"sep\" , \"okt\" , \"nov\" , \"dec\" ] Similarly you can customize the weekday names with the \"dayNames\" option. An example in French: dayNames : [ \"dim\" , \"lun\" , \"mar\" , \"mer\" , \"jeu\" , \"ven\" , \"sam\" ] If you set \"twelveHourClock\" to true, the autogenerated timestamps will use 12 hour AM/PM timestamps instead of 24 hour. This only applies if you have not set \"timeformat\". Use the \"%I\" and \"%p\" or \"%P\" options if you want to build your own format string with 12-hour times. If the Date object has a strftime property (and it is a function), it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Thus you can include a strftime library such as http://hacks.bluesmoon.info/strftime/ for more powerful date/time formatting. If everything else fails, you can control the formatting by specifying a custom tick formatter function as usual. Here's a simple example which will format December 24 as 24/12: tickFormatter : function ( val , axis ) { var d = new Date ( val ); return d . getUTCDate () + \"/\" + ( d . getUTCMonth () + 1 ); } Note that for the time mode \"tickSize\" and \"minTickSize\" are a bit special in that they are arrays on the form \"[value, unit]\" where unit is one of \"second\", \"minute\", \"hour\", \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\". So you can specify minTickSize : [ 1 , \"month\" ] to get a tick interval size of at least 1 month and correspondingly, if axis.tickSize is [2, \"day\"] in the tick formatter, the ticks have been produced with two days in-between.","title":"Time series data"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-data-series","text":"series : { lines , points , bars : { show : boolean lineWidth : number fill : boolean or number fillColor : null or color / gradient } lines , bars : { zero : boolean } points : { radius : number symbol : \"circle\" or function } bars : { barWidth : number align : \"left\" , \"right\" or \"center\" horizontal : boolean } lines : { steps : boolean } shadowSize : number highlightColor : color or number } colors : [ color1 , color2 , ... ] The options inside \"series: {}\" are copied to each of the series. So you can specify that all series should have bars by putting it in the global options, or override it for individual series by specifying bars in a particular the series object in the array of data. The most important options are \"lines\", \"points\" and \"bars\" that specify whether and how lines, points and bars should be shown for each data series. In case you don't specify anything at all, Flot will default to showing lines (you can turn this off with lines: { show: false }). You can specify the various types independently of each other, and Flot will happily draw each of them in turn (this is probably only useful for lines and points), e.g. var options = { series : { lines : { show : true , fill : true , fillColor : \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\" }, points : { show : true , fill : false } } }; \"lineWidth\" is the thickness of the line or outline in pixels. You can set it to 0 to prevent a line or outline from being drawn; this will also hide the shadow. \"fill\" is whether the shape should be filled. For lines, this produces area graphs. You can use \"fillColor\" to specify the color of the fill. If \"fillColor\" evaluates to false (default for everything except points which are filled with white), the fill color is auto-set to the color of the data series. You can adjust the opacity of the fill by setting fill to a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). For bars, fillColor can be a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. \"barWidth\" is the width of the bars in units of the x axis (or the y axis if \"horizontal\" is true), contrary to most other measures that are specified in pixels. For instance, for time series the unit is milliseconds so 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 produces bars with the width of a day. \"align\" specifies whether a bar should be left-aligned (default), right-aligned or centered on top of the value it represents. When \"horizontal\" is on, the bars are drawn horizontally, i.e. from the y axis instead of the x axis; note that the bar end points are still defined in the same way so you'll probably want to swap the coordinates if you've been plotting vertical bars first. Area and bar charts normally start from zero, regardless of the data's range. This is because they convey information through size, and starting from a different value would distort their meaning. In cases where the fill is purely for decorative purposes, however, \"zero\" allows you to override this behavior. It defaults to true for filled lines and bars; setting it to false tells the series to use the same automatic scaling as an un-filled line. For lines, \"steps\" specifies whether two adjacent data points are connected with a straight (possibly diagonal) line or with first a horizontal and then a vertical line. Note that this transforms the data by adding extra points. For points, you can specify the radius and the symbol. The only built-in symbol type is circles, for other types you can use a plugin or define them yourself by specifying a callback: function cross ( ctx , x , y , radius , shadow ) { var size = radius * Math . sqrt ( Math . PI ) / 2 ; ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y - size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y + size ); ctx . moveTo ( x - size , y + size ); ctx . lineTo ( x + size , y - size ); } The parameters are the drawing context, x and y coordinates of the center of the point, a radius which corresponds to what the circle would have used and whether the call is to draw a shadow (due to limited canvas support, shadows are currently faked through extra draws). It's good practice to ensure that the area covered by the symbol is the same as for the circle with the given radius, this ensures that all symbols have approximately the same visual weight. \"shadowSize\" is the default size of shadows in pixels. Set it to 0 to remove shadows. \"highlightColor\" is the default color of the translucent overlay used to highlight the series when the mouse hovers over it. The \"colors\" array specifies a default color theme to get colors for the data series from. You can specify as many colors as you like, like this: colors : [ \"#d18b2c\" , \"#dba255\" , \"#919733\" ] If there are more data series than colors, Flot will try to generate extra colors by lightening and darkening colors in the theme.","title":"Customizing the data series"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#customizing-the-grid","text":"grid : { show : boolean aboveData : boolean color : color backgroundColor : color / gradient or null margin : number or margin object labelMargin : number axisMargin : number markings : array of markings or ( fn : axes -> array of markings ) borderWidth : number or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different widths borderColor : color or null or object with \"top\" , \"right\" , \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties with different colors minBorderMargin : number or null clickable : boolean hoverable : boolean autoHighlight : boolean mouseActiveRadius : number } interaction : { redrawOverlayInterval : number or - 1 } The grid is the thing with the axes and a number of ticks. Many of the things in the grid are configured under the individual axes, but not all. \"color\" is the color of the grid itself whereas \"backgroundColor\" specifies the background color inside the grid area, here null means that the background is transparent. You can also set a gradient, see the gradient documentation below. You can turn off the whole grid including tick labels by setting \"show\" to false. \"aboveData\" determines whether the grid is drawn above the data or below (below is default). \"margin\" is the space in pixels between the canvas edge and the grid, which can be either a number or an object with individual margins for each side, in the form: margin : { top : top margin in pixels left : left margin in pixels bottom : bottom margin in pixels right : right margin in pixels } \"labelMargin\" is the space in pixels between tick labels and axis line, and \"axisMargin\" is the space in pixels between axes when there are two next to each other. \"borderWidth\" is the width of the border around the plot. Set it to 0 to disable the border. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different widths. You can also set \"borderColor\" if you want the border to have a different color than the grid lines. Set it to an object with \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" and \"left\" properties to use different colors. \"minBorderMargin\" controls the default minimum margin around the border - it's used to make sure that points aren't accidentally clipped by the canvas edge so by default the value is computed from the point radius. \"markings\" is used to draw simple lines and rectangular areas in the background of the plot. You can either specify an array of ranges on the form { xaxis: { from, to }, yaxis: { from, to } } (with multiple axes, you can specify coordinates for other axes instead, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/...) or with a function that returns such an array given the axes for the plot in an object as the first parameter. You can set the color of markings by specifying \"color\" in the ranges object. Here's an example array: markings : [ { xaxis : { from : 0 , to : 2 }, yaxis : { from : 10 , to : 10 }, color : \"#bb0000\" }, ... ] If you leave out one of the values, that value is assumed to go to the border of the plot. So for example if you only specify { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 2 } } it means an area that extends from the top to the bottom of the plot in the x range 0-2. A line is drawn if from and to are the same, e.g. markings : [ { yaxis : { from : 1 , to : 1 } }, ... ] would draw a line parallel to the x axis at y = 1. You can control the line width with \"lineWidth\" in the range object. An example function that makes vertical stripes might look like this: markings : function ( axes ) { var markings = []; for ( var x = Math . floor ( axes . xaxis . min ); x < axes . xaxis . max ; x += 2 ) markings . push ({ xaxis : { from : x , to : x + 1 } }); return markings ; } If you set \"clickable\" to true, the plot will listen for click events on the plot area and fire a \"plotclick\" event on the placeholder with a position and a nearby data item object as parameters. The coordinates are available both in the unit of the axes (not in pixels) and in global screen coordinates. Likewise, if you set \"hoverable\" to true, the plot will listen for mouse move events on the plot area and fire a \"plothover\" event with the same parameters as the \"plotclick\" event. If \"autoHighlight\" is true (the default), nearby data items are highlighted automatically. If needed, you can disable highlighting and control it yourself with the highlight/unhighlight plot methods described elsewhere. You can use \"plotclick\" and \"plothover\" events like this: $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ d ], { grid : { clickable : true } }); $ ( \"#placeholder\" ). bind ( \"plotclick\" , function ( event , pos , item ) { alert ( \"You clicked at \" + pos . x + \", \" + pos . y ); // axis coordinates for other axes, if present, are in pos.x2, pos.x3, ... // if you need global screen coordinates, they are pos.pageX, pos.pageY if ( item ) { highlight ( item . series , item . datapoint ); alert ( \"You clicked a point!\" ); } }); The item object in this example is either null or a nearby object on the form: item : { datapoint : the point , e . g . [ 0 , 2 ] dataIndex : the index of the point in the data array series : the series object seriesIndex : the index of the series pageX , pageY : the global screen coordinates of the point } For instance, if you have specified the data like this $ . plot ( $ ( \"#placeholder\" ), [ { label : \"Foo\" , data : [[ 0 , 10 ], [ 7 , 3 ]] } ], ...); and the mouse is near the point (7, 3), \"datapoint\" is [7, 3], \"dataIndex\" will be 1, \"series\" is a normalized series object with among other things the \"Foo\" label in series.label and the color in series.color, and \"seriesIndex\" is 0. Note that plugins and options that transform the data can shift the indexes from what you specified in the original data array. If you use the above events to update some other information and want to clear out that info in case the mouse goes away, you'll probably also need to listen to \"mouseout\" events on the placeholder div. \"mouseActiveRadius\" specifies how far the mouse can be from an item and still activate it. If there are two or more points within this radius, Flot chooses the closest item. For bars, the top-most bar (from the latest specified data series) is chosen. If you want to disable interactivity for a specific data series, you can set \"hoverable\" and \"clickable\" to false in the options for that series, like this: { data : [...], label : \"Foo\" , clickable : false } \"redrawOverlayInterval\" specifies the maximum time to delay a redraw of interactive things (this works as a rate limiting device).

You can either specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a \"plotclick\" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g. highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series (remember, zero-based indexing). unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight() Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as highlight. If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed. setData(data) You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards. You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw() plotting the data so in this case don't bother. setupGrid() Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc. Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM) the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the canvas redrawn. draw() Redraws the plot canvas. triggerRedrawOverlay() Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive redraws (e.g. from a mousemove). You can get to the overlay by setting up a drawOverlay hook. width()/height() Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid. This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some extra space is needed (e.g. for labels). offset() Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position inside the plot). pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos }) Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. ```js o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 }) // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div ```` resize() Tells Flot to resize the drawing canvas to the size of the placeholder. You need to run setupGrid() and draw() afterwards as canvas resizing is a destructive operation. This is used internally by the resize plugin. shutdown() Cleans up any event handlers Flot has currently registered. This is used internally. There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful. getData() Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized form with missing settings filled in according to the global options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned to the data series, you could do this: var series = plot . getData (); for ( var i = 0 ; i < series . length ; ++ i ) alert ( series [ i ]. color ); A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints which has a field \"points\" with the normalized data points in a flat array (the field \"pointsize\" is the increment in the flat array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of (x,y) pairs it would be 2). getAxes() Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the x axis. Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset. Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or output an axis with console.log() and inspect it). With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis, etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check y2axis.used to see whether the axis is associated with any data points and y2axis.show to see if it is currently shown. getPlaceholder() Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events. getCanvas() Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too. getPlotOffset() Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object with distances from the canvas edges as \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \"bottom\". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left corner of the grid. getOptions() Gets the options for the plot, normalized, with default values filled in. You get a reference to actual values used by Flot, so if you modify the values in here, Flot will use the new values. If you change something, you probably have to call draw() or setupGrid() or triggerRedrawOverlay() to see the change.","title":"Plot Methods"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#hooks","text":"In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a callback function at various points in the process, the function then gets access to the internal data structures in Flot. Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through: Plugin initialization, parsing options Constructing the canvases used for drawing Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors, copying raw data points into internal format, normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick labels, the legend Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn Setting up event handling for interactive features Responding to events, if any Shutdown: this mostly happens in case a plot is overwritten Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array. You can add them through the \"hooks\" option, and they are also available after the plot is constructed as the \"hooks\" attribute on the returned plot object, e.g. // define a simple draw hook function hellohook ( plot , canvascontext ) { alert ( \"hello!\" ); }; // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several var plot = $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { hooks : { draw : [ hellohook ] } }); // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin // has added other hooks The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot. processOptions [phase 1] function(plot, options) Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been enabled and then turn on or off other options. processRawData [phase 3] function(plot, series, data, datapoints) Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points, Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series. In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format, an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and how it interferes with axis scaling. It accepts the following options: { x , y : boolean , number : boolean , required : boolean , defaultValue : value , autoscale : boolean } \"x\" and \"y\" specify whether the value is plotted against the x or y axis, and is currently used only to calculate axis min-max ranges. The default format array, for example, looks like this: [ { x : true , number : true , required : true }, { y : true , number : true , required : true } ] This indicates that a point, i.e. [0, 25], consists of two values, with the first being plotted on the x axis and the second on the y axis. If \"number\" is true, then the value must be numeric, and is set to null if it cannot be converted to a number. \"defaultValue\" provides a fallback in case the original value is null. This is for instance handy for bars, where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar), which then defaults to zero. If \"required\" is true, then the value must exist (be non-null) for the point as a whole to be valid. If no value is provided, then the entire point is cleared out with nulls, turning it into a gap in the series. \"autoscale\" determines whether the value is considered when calculating an automatic min-max range for the axes that the value is plotted against. processDatapoints [phase 3] function(plot, series, datapoints) Called after normalization of the given series but before finding min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data transformations. \"datapoints\" contains the normalized data points in a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that multiplies all y coordinates by 2: function multiply ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var points = datapoints . points , ps = datapoints . pointsize ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < points . length ; i += ps ) points [ i + 1 ] *= 2 ; } Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards. processOffset [phase 4] function(plot, offset) Called after Flot has initialized the plot's offset, but before it draws any axes or plot elements. This hook is useful for customizing the margins between the grid and the edge of the canvas. \"offset\" is an object with attributes \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\" and \"right\", corresponding to the margins on the four sides of the plot. drawBackground [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Called before all other drawing operations. Used to draw backgrounds or other custom elements before the plot or axes have been drawn. drawSeries [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext, series) Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws each series. draw [phase 5] function(plot, canvascontext) Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code. bindEvents [phase 6] function(plot, eventHolder) Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the canvas, e.g. function ( plot , eventHolder ) { eventHolder . mousedown ( function ( e ) { alert ( \"You pressed the mouse at \" + e . pageX + \" \" + e . pageY ); }); } Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example. Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the overlay or for the static canvas). Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first argument to the plot call. You can get that with plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use if you need to fire a custom event. drawOverlay [phase 7] function (plot, canvascontext) The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when the overlay canvas is to be redrawn. \"canvascontext\" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the crosshair plugin for an example. shutdown [phase 8] function (plot, eventHolder) Run when plot.shutdown() is called, which usually only happens in case a plot is overwritten by a new plot. If you're writing a plugin that adds extra DOM elements or event handlers, you should add a callback to clean up after you. Take a look at the section in the PLUGINS document for more info.","title":"Hooks"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/API/#plugins","text":"Plugins extend the functionality of Flot. To use a plugin, simply include its Javascript file after Flot in the HTML page.

Here's a brief explanation of how the plugin plumbings work: Each plugin registers itself in the global array $.plot.plugins. When you make a new plot object with $.plot, Flot goes through this array calling the \"init\" function of each plugin and merging default options from the \"option\" attribute of the plugin. The init function gets a reference to the plot object created and uses this to register hooks and add new public methods if needed. See the PLUGINS document for details on how to write a plugin.

Flot will happily draw everything you send to it so the answer depends on the browser. The excanvas emulation used for IE (built with VML) makes IE by far the slowest browser so be sure to test with that if IE users are in your target group (for large plots in IE, you can also check out Flashcanvas which may be faster). 1000 points is not a problem, but as soon as you start having more points than the pixel width, you should probably start thinking about downsampling/aggregation as this is near the resolution limit of the chart anyway. If you downsample server-side, you also save bandwidth. Flot isn't working when I'm using JSON data as source! Actually, Flot loves JSON data, you just got the format wrong.

And it doesn't work with excanvas which uses VML, but you could try Flashcanvas. The bars are all tiny in time mode? It's not really possible to determine the bar width automatically. So you have to set the width with the barWidth option which is NOT in pixels, but in the units of the x axis (or the y axis for horizontal bars).

(reported by Matthew Sabol and sloker, issues #997 ad #1081) Bug fixes Fixed an unexpected change in behavior that resulted in duplicate tick labels when using a plugin, like flot-tickrotor, that overrode tick labels. (patch by Mark Cote, pull request #1091) Fixed a regression from 0.7 where axis labels were given the wrong width, causing them to overlap at certain scales and ignore the labelWidth option. (patch by Benjamin Gram, pull request #1177) Fixed a bug where the second axis in an xaxes/yaxes array incorrectly had its 'innermost' property set to false or undefined, even if it was on the other side of the plot from the first axis. This resulted in the axis bar being visible when it shouldn't have been, which was especially obvious when the grid had a left/right border width of zero. (reported by Teq1, fix researched by ryleyb, issue #1056) Fixed an error when using a placeholder that has no font-size property. (patch by Craig Oldford, pull request #1135) Fixed a regression from 0.7 where nulls at the end of a series were ignored for purposes of determing the range of the x-axis. (reported by Munsifali Rashid, issue #1095) If a font size is provided, base the default lineHeight on that size rather that the font size of the plot placeholder, which may be very different. (reported by Daniel Hoffmann Bernardes, issue #1131, pull request #1199) Fix broken highlighting for right-aligned bars. (reported by BeWiBu and Mihai Stanciu, issues #975 and #1093, with further assistance by Eric Byers, pull request #1120) Prevent white circles from sometimes showing up inside of pie charts. (reported by Pierre Dubois and Jack Klink, issues #1128 and #1073) Label formatting no longer breaks when a page contains multiple pie charts. (reported by Brend Wanders, issue #1055) When using multiple axes on opposite sides of the plot, the innermost axis coming later in the list no longer has its bar drawn incorrectly. (reported by ryleyb, issue #1056) When removing series labels and redrawing the plot, the legend now updates correctly even when using an external container. (patch by Luis Silva, issue #1159, pull request #1160) The pie plugin no longer ignores the value of the left offset option. (reported by melanker, issue #1136) Fixed a regression from 0.7, where extra padding was added unnecessarily to sides of the plot where there was no last tick label. (reported by sknob001, issue #1048, pull request #1200) Fixed incorrect tooltip behavior in the interacting example. (patch by cleroux, issue #686, pull request #1074) Fixed an error in CSS color extraction with elements outside the DOM. (patch by execjosh, pull request #1084) Fixed :not selector error when using jQuery without Sizzle. (patch by Anthony Ryan, pull request #1180) Worked around a browser issue that caused bars to appear un-filled. (reported by irbian, issue #915) Flot 0.8.1 Bug fixes Fixed a regression in the time plugin, introduced in 0.8, that caused dates to align to the minute rather than to the highest appropriate unit. This caused many x-axes in 0.8 to have different ticks than they did in 0.7. (reported by Tom Sheppard, patch by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1017, pull request #1023) Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, that caused axis labels with the same text as another label on the same axis to disappear. More generally, it's again possible to have the same text in two locations. (issue #1032) Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, where axis labels were no longer assigned an explicit width, and their text could not wrap. (reported by sabregreen, issue #1019) Fixed a regression in the pie plugin, introduced in 0.8, that prevented it from accepting data in the format '[[x, y]]'. (patch by Nicolas Morel, pull request #1024) The 'zero' series option and 'autoscale' format option are no longer ignored when the series contains a null value. (reported by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1033) Avoid triggering the time-mode plugin exception when there are zero series. (reported by Daniel Rothig, patch by Mark Raymond, issue #1016) When a custom color palette has fewer colors than the default palette, Flot no longer fills out the colors with the remainder of the default. (patch by goorpy, issue #1031, pull request #1034) Fixed missing update for bar highlights after a zoom or other redraw. (reported by Paolo Valleri, issue #1030) Fixed compatibility with jQuery versions earlier than 1.7. (patch by Lee Willis, issue #1027, pull request #1027) The mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page when using the navigate plugin. (patch by vird, pull request #1020) Fixed missing semicolons in the core library. (reported by Michal Zglinski) Flot 0.8.0 API changes Support for time series has been moved into a plugin, jquery.flot.time.js. This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540). Changes Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting. (patch by risicle, issue 49) Date/time formatting follows proper subset of strftime specifiers, and support added for Date.prototype.strftime, if found. (patch by Mark Cote, issues 419 and 558) Fixed display of year ticks. (patch by Mark Cote, issue 195) Support for time series moved to plugin. (patch by Mark Cote) Display time series in different time zones. (patch by Knut Forkalsrud, issue 141) Added a canvas plugin to enable rendering axis tick labels to the canvas. (sponsored by YCharts.com, implementation by Ole Laursen and David Schnur) Support for setting the interval between redraws of the overlay canvas with redrawOverlayInterval. (suggested in issue 185) Support for multiple thresholds in thresholds plugin. (patch by Arnaud Bellec, issue 523) Support for plotting categories/textual data directly with new categories plugin. Tick generators now get the whole axis rather than just min/max. Added processOffset and drawBackground hooks. (suggested in issue 639) Added a grid \"margin\" option to set the space between the canvas edge and the grid. Prevent the pie example page from generating single-slice pies. (patch by Shane Reustle) In addition to \"left\" and \"center\", bars now recognize \"right\" as an alignment option. (patch by Michael Mayer, issue 520) Switched from toFixed to a much faster default tickFormatter. (patch by Clemens Stolle) Added to a more helpful error when using a time-mode axis without including the flot.time plugin. (patch by Yael Elmatad) Added a legend \"sorted\" option to control sorting of legend entries independent of their series order. (patch by Tom Cleaveland) Added a series \"highlightColor\" option to control the color of the translucent overlay that identifies the dataset when the mouse hovers over it. (patch by Eric Wendelin and Nate Abele, issues 168 and 299) Added a plugin jquery.flot.errorbars, with an accompanying example, that adds the ability to plot error bars, commonly used in many kinds of statistical data visualizations. (patch by Rui Pereira, issue 215) The legend now omits entries whose labelFormatter returns null. (patch by Tom Cleaveland, Christopher Lambert, and Simon Strandgaard) Added support for high pixel density (retina) displays, resulting in much crisper charts on such devices. (patch by Olivier Guerriat, additional fixes by Julien Thomas, maimairel, and Lau Bech Lauritzen) Added the ability to control pie shadow position and alpha via a new pie 'shadow' option. (patch by Julien Thomas, pull request #78) Added the ability to set width and color for individual sides of the grid. (patch by Ara Anjargolian, additional fixes by Karl Swedberg, pull requests #855 and #880) The selection plugin's getSelection now returns null when the selection has been cleared. (patch by Nick Campbell, pull request #852) Added a new option called 'zero' to bars and filled lines series, to control whether the y-axis minimum is scaled to fit the data or set to zero. (patch by David Schnur, issues #316, #529, and #856, pull request #911) The plot function is now also a jQuery chainable property. (patch by David Schnur, issues #734 and #816, pull request #953) When only a single pie slice is beneath the combine threshold it is no longer replaced by an 'other' slice. (suggested by Devin Bayer, issue #638) Added lineJoin and minSize options to the selection plugin to control the corner style and minimum size of the selection, respectively. (patch by Ruth Linehan, pull request #963) Bug fixes Fix problem with null values and pie plugin. (patch by gcruxifix, issue 500) Fix problem with threshold plugin and bars. (based on patch by kaarlenkaski, issue 348) Fix axis box calculations so the boxes include the outermost part of the labels too.

(patch by Eddie Kay) Prevent pie slice outlines from being drawn when the stroke width is zero. (reported by Chris Minett, issue 585) Updated the navigate plugin's inline copy of jquery.mousewheel to fix Webkit zoom problems. (reported by Hau Nguyen, issue 685) Axis labels no longer appear as decimals rather than integers in certain cases. (patch by Clemens Stolle, issue 541) Automatic color generation no longer produces only whites and blacks when there are many series. (patch by David Schnur and Tom Cleaveland) Fixed an error when custom tick labels weren't provided as strings. (patch by Shad Downey) Prevented the local insertSteps and fmt variables from becoming global. (first reported by Marc Bennewitz and Szymon Barglowski, patch by Nick Campbell, issues #825 and #831, pull request #851) Prevented several threshold plugin variables from becoming global. (patch by Lasse Dahl Ebert) Fixed various jQuery 1.8 compatibility issues. (issues #814 and #819, pull request #877) Pie charts with a slice equal to or approaching 100% of the pie no longer appear invisible. (patch by David Schnur, issues #444, #658, #726, #824 and #850, pull request #879) Prevented several local variables from becoming global. (patch by aaa707) Ensure that the overlay and primary canvases remain aligned. (issue #670, pull request #901) Added support for jQuery 1.9 by removing and replacing uses of $.browser. (analysis and patch by Anthony Ryan, pull request #905) Pie charts no longer disappear when redrawn during a resize or update. (reported by Julien Bec, issue #656, pull request #910) Avoided floating-point precision errors when calculating pie percentages. (patch by James Ward, pull request #918) Fixed compatibility with jQuery 1.2.6, which has no 'mouseleave' shortcut. (reported by Bevan, original pull request #920, replaced by direct patch) Fixed sub-pixel rendering issues with crosshair and selection lines. (patches by alanayoub and Daniel Shapiro, pull requests #17 and #925) Fixed rendering issues when using the threshold plugin with several series. (patch by Ivan Novikov, pull request #934) Pie charts no longer disappear when redrawn after calling setData(). (reported by zengge1984 and pareeohnos, issues #810 and #945) Added a work-around for the problem where points with a lineWidth of zero still showed up with a visible line. (reported by SalvoSav, issue #842, patch by Jamie Hamel-Smith, pull request #937) Pie charts now accept values in string form, like other plot types. (reported by laerdal.no, issue #534) Avoid rounding errors in the threshold plugin. (reported by jerikojerk, issue #895) Fixed an error when using the navigate plugin with jQuery 1.9.x or later. (reported by Paolo Valleri, issue #964) Fixed inconsistencies between the highlight and unhighlight functions. (reported by djamshed, issue #987) Fixed recalculation of tickSize and tickDecimals on calls to setupGrid. (patch by thecountofzero, pull request #861, issues #860, #1000) Flot 0.7 API changes Multiple axes support. Code using dual axes should be changed from using x2axis/y2axis in the options to using an array (although backwards- compatibility hooks are in place). For instance, { xaxis : { ... }, x2axis : { ... }, yaxis : { ... }, y2axis : { ... } } becomes { xaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ], yaxes : [ { ... }, { ... } ] } Note that if you're just using one axis, continue to use the xaxis/yaxis directly (it now sets the default settings for the arrays). Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra axes into account, check the source to see some examples. A related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected. So if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in the chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly. \"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a corresponding option on the axes, so: { grid : { tickColor : \"#000\" }} becomes { xaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" }, yaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" } } But if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a tick color by adding transparency. Backwards-compatibility hooks are in place. Final note: now that IE 9 is coming out with canvas support, you may want to adapt the excanvas include to skip loading it in IE 9 (the examples have been adapted thanks to Ryley Breiddal). An alternative to excanvas using Flash has also surfaced, if your graphs are slow in IE, you may want to give it a spin: http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/ Changes Support for specifying a bottom for each point for line charts when filling them, this means that an arbitrary bottom can be used instead of just the x axis. (based on patches patiently provided by Roman V. Prikhodchenko) New fillbetween plugin that can compute a bottom for a series from another series, useful for filling areas between lines. See new example percentiles.html for a use case. More predictable handling of gaps for the stacking plugin, now all undefined ranges are skipped. Stacking plugin can stack horizontal bar charts. Navigate plugin now redraws the plot while panning instead of only after the fact. (raised by lastthemy, issue 235) Can be disabled by setting the pan.frameRate option to null. Date formatter now accepts %0m and %0d to get a zero-padded month or day. (issue raised by Maximillian Dornseif) Revamped internals to support an unlimited number of axes, not just dual. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) New setting on axes, \"tickLength\", to control the size of ticks or turn them off without turning off the labels. Axis labels are now put in container divs with classes, for instance labels in the x axes can be reached via \".xAxis .tickLabel\". Support for setting the color of an axis. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Tick color is now auto-generated as the base color with some transparency, unless you override it. Support for aligning ticks in the axes with \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to ensure that they appear next to each other rather than in between, at the expense of possibly awkward tick steps. (sponsored by Flight Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com) Support for customizing the point type through a callback when plotting points and new symbol plugin with some predefined point types. (sponsored by Utility Data Corporation) Resize plugin for automatically redrawing when the placeholder changes size, e.g. on window resizes. (sponsored by Novus Partners) A resize() method has been added to plot object facilitate this. Support Infinity/-Infinity for plotting asymptotes by hacking it into +/-Number.MAX_VALUE. (reported by rabaea.mircea) Support for restricting navigate plugin to not pan/zoom an axis. (based on patch by kkaefer) Support for providing the drag cursor for the navigate plugin as an option. (based on patch by Kelly T. Moore) Options for controlling whether an axis is shown or not (suggestion by Timo Tuominen) and whether to reserve space for it even if it isn't shown. New attribute $.plot.version with the Flot version as a string. The version comment is now included in the minified jquery.flot.min.js. New options.grid.minBorderMargin for adjusting the minimum margin provided around the border (based on patch by corani, issue 188). Refactor replot behaviour so Flot tries to reuse the existing canvas, adding shutdown() methods to the plot. (based on patch by Ryley Breiddal, issue 269) This prevents a memory leak in Chrome and hopefully makes replotting faster for those who are using $.plot instead of .setData()/.draw(). Also update jQuery to 1.5.1 to prevent IE leaks fixed in jQuery. New real-time line chart example. New hooks: drawSeries, shutdown. Bug fixes Fixed problem with findNearbyItem and bars on top of each other. (reported by ragingchikn, issue 242) Fixed problem with ticks and the border. (based on patch from ultimatehustler69, issue 236) Fixed problem with plugins adding options to the series objects. Fixed a problem introduced in 0.6 with specifying a gradient with: {brightness: x, opacity: y } Don't use $.browser.msie, check for getContext on the created canvas element instead and try to use excanvas if it's not found. Fixes IE 9 compatibility. highlight(s, index) was looking up the point in the original s.data instead of in the computed datapoints array, which breaks with plugins that modify the datapoints, such as the stacking plugin. (reported by curlypaul924, issue 316) More robust handling of axis from data passed in from getData(). (reported) by Morgan) Fixed problem with turning off bar outline. (fix by Jordi Castells, issue 253) Check the selection passed into setSelection in the selection plugin, to guard against errors when synchronizing plots (fix by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Fix bug in crosshair code with mouseout resetting the crosshair even if it is locked (fix by Lau Bech Lauritzen and Banko Adam). Fix bug with points plotting using line width from lines rather than points. Fix bug with passing non-array 0 data (for plugins that don't expect arrays, patch by vpapp1). Fix errors in JSON in examples so they work with jQuery 1.4.2 (fix reported by honestbleeps, issue 357). Fix bug with tooltip in interacting.html, this makes the tooltip much smoother (fix by bdkahn). Fix related bug inside highlighting handler in Flot. Use closure trick to make inline colorhelpers plugin respect jQuery.noConflict(true), renaming the global jQuery object (reported by Nick Stielau). Listen for mouseleave events and fire a plothover event with empty item when it occurs to drop highlights when the mouse leaves the plot (reported by by outspirit). Fix bug with using aboveData with a background (reported by amitayd). Fix possible excanvas leak (report and suggested fix by tom9729). Fix bug with backwards compatibility for shadowSize = 0 (report and suggested fix by aspinak). Adapt examples to skip loading excanvas (fix by Ryley Breiddal). Fix bug that prevent a simple f(x) = -x transform from working correctly (fix by Mike, issue 263). Fix bug in restoring cursor in navigate plugin (reported by Matteo Gattanini, issue 395). Fix bug in picking items when transform/inverseTransform is in use (reported by Ofri Raviv, and patches and analysis by Jan and Tom Paton, issue 334 and 467). Fix problem with unaligned ticks and hover/click events caused by padding on the placeholder by hardcoding the placeholder padding to 0 (reported by adityadineshsaxena, Matt Sommer, Daniel Atos and some other people, issue 301). Update colorhelpers plugin to avoid dying when trying to parse an invalid string (reported by cadavor, issue 483). Flot 0.6 API changes Selection support has been moved to a plugin. Thus if you're passing selection: { mode: something }, you MUST include the file jquery.flot.selection.js after jquery.flot.js. This reduces the size of base Flot and makes it easier to customize the selection as well as improving code clarity. The change is based on a patch from andershol. In the global options specified in the $.plot command, \"lines\", \"points\", \"bars\" and \"shadowSize\" have been moved to a sub-object called \"series\": $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { lines : { show : true }}) should be changed to $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { series : { lines : { show : true }}}) All future series-specific options will go into this sub-object to simplify plugin writing. Backward-compatibility code is in place, so old code should not break. \"plothover\" no longer provides the original data point, but instead a normalized one, since there may be no corresponding original point. Due to a bug in previous versions of jQuery, you now need at least jQuery 1.2.6. But if you can, try jQuery 1.3.2 as it got some improvements in event handling speed. Changes Added support for disabling interactivity for specific data series. (request from Ronald Schouten and Steve Upton) Flot now calls $() on the placeholder and optional legend container passed in so you can specify DOM elements or CSS expressions to make it easier to use Flot with libraries like Prototype or Mootools or through raw JSON from Ajax responses. A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making a selection. The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most 10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if you're doing something really expensive on this event. The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even replaced. Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid. (patches from Amaury Chamayou and Mike R. Williamson) Added support for gradient backgrounds for the grid. (based on patch from Amaury Chamayou, issue 90) The \"setting options\" example provides a demonstration. Gradient bars. (suggestion by stefpet) Added a \"plotunselected\" event which is triggered when the selection is removed, see \"selection\" example. (suggestion by Meda Ugo) The option legend.margin can now specify horizontal and vertical margins independently. (suggestion by someone who's annoyed) Data passed into Flot is now copied to a new canonical format to enable further processing before it hits the drawing routines. As a side-effect, this should make Flot more robust in the face of bad data. (issue 112) Step-wise charting: line charts have a new option \"steps\" that when set to true connects the points with horizontal/vertical steps instead of diagonal lines. The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just the label. (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier) Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun). Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked bars. New option to disable the (grid.show). Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an offset within the placeholder. Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to internal state. Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some hooks are defined, more are likely to come. Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines. Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use). Image plugin: plot prerendered images. Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot. More configurable grid. Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends). Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge). The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin. It's included inline in the Flot source to make dependency managing easier. This also makes it really easy to use the color helpers in Flot plugins. Bug fixes Fixed two corner-case bugs when drawing filled curves. (report and analysis by Joshua Varner) Fix auto-adjustment code when setting min to 0 for an axis where the dataset is completely flat on that axis. (report by chovy) Fixed a bug with passing in data from getData to setData when the secondary axes are used. (reported by nperelman, issue 65) Fixed so that it is possible to turn lines off when no other chart type is shown (based on problem reported by Glenn Vanderburg), and fixed so that setting lineWidth to 0 also hides the shadow. (based on problem reported by Sergio Nunes) Updated mousemove position expression to the latest from jQuery. (reported by meyuchas) Use CSS borders instead of background in legend. (issues 25 and 45) Explicitly convert axis min/max to numbers. Fixed a bug with drawing marking lines with different colors. (reported by Khurram) Fixed a bug with returning y2 values in the selection event. (fix by exists, issue 75) Only set position relative on placeholder if it hasn't already a position different from static. (reported by kyberneticist, issue 95) Don't round markings to prevent sub-pixel problems. (reported by Dan Lipsitt) Make the grid border act similarly to a regular CSS border, i.e. prevent it from overlapping the plot itself. This also fixes a problem with anti- aliasing when the width is 1 pixel. (reported by Anthony Ettinger) Imported version 3 of excanvas and fixed two issues with the newer version. Hopefully, this will make Flot work with IE8. (nudge by Fabien Menager, further analysis by Booink, issue 133) Changed the shadow code for lines to hopefully look a bit better with vertical lines. Round tick positions to avoid possible problems with fractions. (suggestion by Fred, issue 130) Made the heuristic for determining how many ticks to aim for a bit smarter. Fix for uneven axis margins (report and patch by Paul Kienzle) and snapping to ticks. (report and patch by lifthrasiir) Fixed bug with slicing in findNearbyItems. (patch by zollman) Make heuristic for x axis label widths more dynamic. (patch by rickinhethuis) Make sure points on top take precedence when finding nearby points when hovering. (reported by didroe, issue 224) Flot 0.5 Timestamps are now in UTC. Also \"selected\" event -> becomes \"plotselected\" with new data, the parameters for setSelection are now different (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place), coloredAreas becomes markings with a new interface (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place). API changes Timestamps in time mode are now displayed according to UTC instead of the time zone of the visitor. This affects the way the timestamps should be input; you'll probably have to offset the timestamps according to your local time zone. It also affects any custom date handling code (which basically now should use the equivalent UTC date mehods, e.g. .setUTCMonth() instead of .setMonth(). Markings, previously coloredAreas, are now specified as ranges on the axes, like { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }} . Furthermore with markings you can now draw horizontal/vertical lines by setting from and to to the same coordinate. (idea from line support patch by by Ryan Funduk) Interactivity: added a new \"plothover\" event and this and the \"plotclick\" event now returns the closest data item (based on patch by /david, patch by Mark Byers for bar support). See the revamped \"interacting with the data\" example for some hints on what you can do. Highlighting: you can now highlight points and datapoints are autohighlighted when you hover over them (if hovering is turned on). Support for dual axis has been added (based on patch by someone who's annoyed and /david). For each data series you can specify which axes it belongs to, and there are two more axes, x2axis and y2axis, to customize. This affects the \"selected\" event which has been renamed to \"plotselected\" and spews out { xaxis: { from: -10, to: 20 } ... }, setSelection in which the parameters are on a new form (backwards compatible hooks are in place so old code shouldn't break) and markings (formerly coloredAreas). Changes Added support for specifying the size of tick labels (axis.labelWidth, axis.labelHeight). Useful for specifying a max label size to keep multiple plots aligned. The \"fill\" option can now be a number that specifies the opacity of the fill. You can now specify a coordinate as null (like [2, null]) and Flot will take the other coordinate into account when scaling the axes. (based on patch by joebno) New option for bars \"align\". Set it to \"center\" to center the bars on the value they represent. setSelection now takes a second parameter which you can use to prevent the method from firing the \"plotselected\" handler. Improved the handling of axis auto-scaling with bars. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in calculating spacing around the plot. (reported by timothytoe) Fixed a bug in finding max values for all-negative data sets. Prevent the possibility of eternal looping in tick calculations. Fixed a bug when borderWidth is set to 0.

(reported by MikeM) Fixed a bug with 'nw' and 'sw' legend positions. Fixed a bug with multi-line x-axis tick labels. (reported by Luca Ciano, IE-fix help by Savage Zhang) Using the \"container\" option in legend now overwrites the container element instead of just appending to it, fixing the infinite legend bug. (reported by several people, fix by Brad Dewey) Flot 0.4 API changes Deprecated axis.noTicks in favor of just specifying the number as axis.ticks. So xaxis: { noTicks: 10 } becomes xaxis: { ticks: 10 } . Time series support. Specify axis.mode: \"time\", put in Javascript timestamps as data, and Flot will automatically spit out sensible ticks. Take a look at the two new examples. The format can be customized with axis.timeformat and axis.monthNames, or if that fails with axis.tickFormatter. Support for colored background areas via grid.coloredAreas. Specify an array of { x1, y1, x2, y2 } objects or a function that returns these given { xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax }. More members on the plot object (report by Chris Davies and others). \"getData\" for inspecting the assigned settings on data series (e.g. color) and \"setData\", \"setupGrid\" and \"draw\" for updating the contents without a total replot. The default number of ticks to aim for is now dependent on the size of the plot in pixels. Support for customizing tick interval sizes directly with axis.minTickSize and axis.tickSize. Cleaned up the automatic axis scaling algorithm and fixed how it interacts with ticks. Also fixed a couple of tick-related corner case bugs (one reported by mainstreetmark, another reported by timothytoe). The option axis.tickFormatter now takes a function with two parameters, the second parameter is an optional object with information about the axis. It has min, max, tickDecimals, tickSize. Changes Added support for segmented lines. (based on patch from Michael MacDonald) Added support for ignoring null and bad values. (suggestion from Nick Konidaris and joshwaihi) Added support for changing the border width. (thanks to joebno and safoo) Label colors can be changed via CSS by selecting the tickLabel class. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in handling single-item bar series. (reported by Emil Filipov) Fixed erratic behaviour when interacting with the plot with IE 7. (reported by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Prevent IE/Safari text selection when selecting stuff on the canvas. Flot 0.3 This is mostly a quick-fix release because jquery.js wasn't included in the previous zip/tarball. Changes Include jquery.js in the zip/tarball. Support clicking on the plot. Turn it on with grid: { clickable: true }, then you get a \"plotclick\" event on the graph placeholder with the position in units of the plot. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in dealing with data where min = max. (thanks to Michael Messinides) Flot 0.2 The API should now be fully documented. API changes Moved labelMargin option to grid from x/yaxis. Changes Added support for putting a background behind the default legend. The default is the partly transparent background color. Added backgroundColor and backgroundOpacity to the legend options to control this. The ticks options can now be a callback function that takes one parameter, an object with the attributes min and max. The function should return a ticks array. Added labelFormatter option in legend, useful for turning the legend labels into links. Reduced the size of the code.

This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to \"time\". When the axis mode is \"time\", the axis option \"timezone\" can be set to null, \"browser\", or a particular timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\") to control how the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If \"browser\", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser. Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters. Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype, it will be used instead of the built-in formatter. Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'. The text containers for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and 'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version. In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default for the tick-mark color. The color of tick label text is now set either by overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option. A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image. The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render, and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units. The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas. The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes \"flot-base\" and \"flot-overlay\" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540).","title":"API changes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/NEWS/#changes_2","text":"Addition of nonstandard %q specifier to date/time formatting.

Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra axes into account, check the source to see some examples. A related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected. So if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in the chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly. \"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a corresponding option on the axes, so: { grid : { tickColor : \"#000\" }} becomes { xaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" }, yaxis : { tickColor : \"#000\" } } But if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a tick color by adding transparency.

In the global options specified in the $.plot command, \"lines\", \"points\", \"bars\" and \"shadowSize\" have been moved to a sub-object called \"series\": $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { lines : { show : true }}) should be changed to $ . plot ( placeholder , data , { series : { lines : { show : true }}}) All future series-specific options will go into this sub-object to simplify plugin writing. Backward-compatibility code is in place, so old code should not break. \"plothover\" no longer provides the original data point, but instead a normalized one, since there may be no corresponding original point. Due to a bug in previous versions of jQuery, you now need at least jQuery 1.2.6. But if you can, try jQuery 1.3.2 as it got some improvements in event handling speed.","title":"API changes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/NEWS/#changes_4","text":"Added support for disabling interactivity for specific data series. (request from Ronald Schouten and Steve Upton) Flot now calls $() on the placeholder and optional legend container passed in so you can specify DOM elements or CSS expressions to make it easier to use Flot with libraries like Prototype or Mootools or through raw JSON from Ajax responses. A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making a selection. The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most 10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if you're doing something really expensive on this event. The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even replaced. Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid. (patches from Amaury Chamayou and Mike R. Williamson) Added support for gradient backgrounds for the grid. (based on patch from Amaury Chamayou, issue 90) The \"setting options\" example provides a demonstration. Gradient bars. (suggestion by stefpet) Added a \"plotunselected\" event which is triggered when the selection is removed, see \"selection\" example. (suggestion by Meda Ugo) The option legend.margin can now specify horizontal and vertical margins independently. (suggestion by someone who's annoyed) Data passed into Flot is now copied to a new canonical format to enable further processing before it hits the drawing routines. As a side-effect, this should make Flot more robust in the face of bad data. (issue 112) Step-wise charting: line charts have a new option \"steps\" that when set to true connects the points with horizontal/vertical steps instead of diagonal lines. The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just the label. (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier) Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun). Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked bars. New option to disable the (grid.show). Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an offset within the placeholder. Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to internal state. Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some hooks are defined, more are likely to come. Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for marking data below 0, for instance. Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have them summed. This is useful for drawing additive/cumulative graphs with bars and (currently unfilled) lines. Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use). Image plugin: plot prerendered images. Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot. More configurable grid. Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends). Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge). The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin. It's included inline in the Flot source to make dependency managing easier. This also makes it really easy to use the color helpers in Flot plugins.","title":"Changes"},{"location":"fromwatsons/t4-reports/sbadmin2-1.0.7/bower_components/flot/NEWS/#bug-fixes_5","text":"Fixed two corner-case bugs when drawing filled curves.

The usual trick here is wrap the above lines in an anonymous function which is called immediately, like this: (function () { inner code ... })(). To make it even more robust in case $ is not bound to jQuery but some other Javascript library, we can write it as ( function ( $ ) { // plugin definition // ... })( jQuery ); There's a complete example below, but you should also check out the plugins bundled with Flot. Complete example Here is a simple debug plugin which alerts each of the series in the plot. It has a single option that control whether it is enabled and how much info to output: ( function ( $ ) { function init ( plot ) { var debugLevel = 1 ; function checkDebugEnabled ( plot , options ) { if ( options . debug ) { debugLevel = options . debug ; plot . hooks . processDatapoints . push ( alertSeries ); } } function alertSeries ( plot , series , datapoints ) { var msg = \"series \" + series . label ; if ( debugLevel > 1 ) { msg += \" with \" + series . data . length + \" points\" ; alert ( msg ); } } plot . hooks . processOptions . push ( checkDebugEnabled ); } var options = { debug : 0 }; $ . plot . plugins . push ({ init : init , options : options , name : \"simpledebug\" , version : \"0.1\" }); })( jQuery ); We also define \"name\" and \"version\".

It can be enabled/disabled through an option. Variables in the init function can be used to store plot-specific state between the hooks. The two last points are important because there may be multiple plots on the same page, and you'd want to make sure they are not mixed up. Shutting down a plugin Each plot object has a shutdown hook which is run when plot.shutdown() is called. This usually mostly happens in case another plot is made on top of an existing one. The purpose of the hook is to give you a chance to unbind any event handlers you've registered and remove any extra DOM things you've inserted. The problem with event handlers is that you can have registered a handler which is run in some point in the future, e.g. with setTimeout(). Meanwhile, the plot may have been shutdown and removed, but because your event handler is still referencing it, it can't be garbage collected yet, and worse, if your handler eventually runs, it may overwrite stuff on a completely different plot. Some hints on the options Plugins should always support appropriate options to enable/disable them because the plugin user may have several plots on the same page where only one should use the plugin. In most cases it's probably a good idea if the plugin is turned off rather than on per default, just like most of the powerful features in Flot. If the plugin needs options that are specific to each series, like the points or lines options in core Flot, you can put them in \"series\" in the options object, e.g. var options = { series : { downsample : { algorithm : null , maxpoints : 1000 } } } Then they will be copied by Flot into each series, providing default values in case none are specified.

Maintained by Mark Cote. Contributions: Xuan Luo Mark Cote stdexcept Clemens Stolle Michael Haddon andig Alex Pinkney flot-axislabels provides flot with the ability to label axes. It supports any number of axes. It can render the labels with CSS transforms, in canvas, or with traditional CSS positioning (\"HTML\" mode). flot-axislabels attempts a graceful fallback from CSS to canvas to HTML if some modes are not supported. You can also force a particular lesser mode (canvas or HTML). In both CSS and canvas modes, the y-axis labels are rotated to face the graph (90 degrees counter-clockwise for left-hand labels, and 90 degrees clockwise for right-hand labels). In HTML mode, y-axis labels are left horizontal (warning: this takes up a lot of space). In CSS and HTML modes, each axis label belongs to the classes \"axisLabels\" and \"[axisName]Label\" (e.g. .xaxisLabel, .y2axisLabel, etc). You can use standard CSS properties to customize their appearance. In canvas mode, you can set font size, family, and colour through flot options (see below). Example $(function () { var options = { axisLabels: { show: true }, xaxes: [{ axisLabel: 'foo', }], yaxes: [{ position: 'left', axisLabel: 'bar', }, { position: 'right', axisLabel: 'bleem' }] }; $.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), yourData, options); ); }); Usage flot-axislabel adds an axisLabels object to the global options object. It supports one option: show (bool): display all axis labels (default: true) There are also several options added to the axis objects. The two main ones are axisLabel (string): the text you want displayed as the label axisLabelPadding (int): padding, in pixels, between the tick labels and the axis label (default: 2) By default, if supported, flot-axislabels uses CSS transforms. You can force either canvas or HTML mode by setting axisLabelUseCanvas or axisLabelUseHtml, respectively, to true. Canvas mode supports several other options: axisLabelFontSizePixels (int): the size, in pixels, of the font (default: 14) axisLabelFontFamily (string): the font family of the font (default: sans-serif) axisLabelColour (string): the font colour (default: black) Compatibility flot-axislabels should work with recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. It also works with IE 8 and 9. The canvas option does not seem to work with IE 8, even with excanvas.
