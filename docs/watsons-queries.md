# Appendix D â€“ Query Definitions and Timings

## Watson's Queries 
![Watsons](wxd-images/poc-query.png)
There are three sets of queries that need to be executed as part of the POC:

* Simple
* Intermediate
* Complex

For each set of queries, there is a serial run stream (run each query three times serially and compute the average) and a concurrent run stream (to test various loads).

The SQL queries can be found in the following links:

* [Serial run stream](wxd-files/mockpoc-serial.tar.gz)
* [Concurrent run stream](wxd-files/mockpoc-concurrent.tar.gz)

## Query Execution Times
The execution time for the queries on the data warehouse are listed below. 

!!! note

    These timings were run on a Netezza data warehouse running on the cloud. Use these as a basis to compare your performance on watsonx.data.

## Watsons JMeter Reports

The following reports were generated by the Watsons' team to use as a comparison against your own results. The report code represents the queries that were used:

* s - Simple users
* i - Intermediate users
* c - C somplex users

Select the report name to view the results.

* [Serial](./fromwatsons/t1-reports/index.html)
* [Concurrency Test s5-i2-c1](./fromwatsons/t2-reports/index.html)
