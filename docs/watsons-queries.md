## Watson's Queries 
![Watsons](wxd-images/poc-query.png)
There are three sets of queries that need to be executed as part of the POC:

* Simple
* Intermediate
* Complex

For each set of queries, there is a serial run stream (run each query three times serially and compute the average) and a concurrent run stream (to test various loads).

The SQL queries can be found in the following links:

* [Serial run stream](wxd-files/mockpoc-serial.tar.gz)
* [Concurrent run stream](wxd-files/mockpoc-concurrent.tar.gz)
