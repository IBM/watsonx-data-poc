## Watsons JMeter Results

!!! note

    These timings were run on a Netezza data warehouse running on the cloud. Use these as a basis to compare your performance on watsonx.data. 

The following reports were generated by the Watsons' team to use as a comparison against your own results. The report code represents the queries that were used:

* s - Simple users
* i - Intermediate users
* c - C somplex users
