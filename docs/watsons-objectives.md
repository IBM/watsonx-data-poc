The main objectives of a proof-of-concept for data warehouse modernization involve showcasing the capability to efficiently transfer data from the current data warehouse to a lakehouse environment, running query workloads effectively, and demonstrating the connectivity of our tools.

### Objectives
* Assess the feasibility of offloading data from the data warehouse to the data lakehouse.
* Validate the adaptability of existing workload processes in the data lakehouse environment.
* Evaluate the performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of the proposed data lakehouse architecture.
* Database JDBC connectivity.

### Success Criteria
* Successful migration of a subset of data from the data warehouse to the data lakehouse for Watson's Great Outdoors Company.
* Demonstrated adaptability of workload processes to the data lakehouse architecture.
* Positive results from performance and scalability tests.
* Identification of potential cost savings and efficiency gains.
