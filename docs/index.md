# IBM watsonx.data Proof of Concept Lab

![WatsonX](wxd-images/watsonxlogoibm.png)

Welcome to the watsonx.data Proof of Concept lab. Upon the completion of this lab, you will have the skills necessary to perform a POC in a customer environment. 

This lab uses the watsonx.data developer package. The Developer package is meant to be used on single nodes, so it has some restrictions compared to a deployment on a cluster. However, the concepts and commands used in the developer edition environment are similar to those used in a cluster. Where commands differ, a separate presentation or video will be provided to highlight the differences.

We organized this lab into a number of sections that cover many of the highlights and key features of watsonx.data.

   * Access a TechZone or VMWare image for testing
   * Checking watsonx.data status
   * Introduction to watsonx.data components
   * Analytical SQL
   * Advanced SQL functions
   * Time Travel and Federation
   * Working with Object Store Buckets

In addition, there is an Appendix which includes common errors and potential fixes or workarounds. 

## Watsonx.data Developer Image 

The watsonx.data system is running on a virtual machine with the following resources:

   * 4 vCPUs
   * 19Gb of memory
   * 400Gb of disk

This is sufficient capacity for running this exercises found in this lab but should not be used for performance testing or dealing with large data sets.

## Watsonx.data Level 3/4 Technical Training

This system is used as a basis for the watsonx.data Level 3/4 Technical Training.
