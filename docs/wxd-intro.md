# IBM Watson's Great Outdoors Proof of Concept Lab

![WatsonX](wxd-images/watsonxlogoibm.png)

Welcome to the Watson's Great Outdoors Proof of Concept lab. Upon the completion of this lab, you have the skills necessary to perform a POC in a customer environment. 

This lab uses the watsonx.data developer package. The Developer package is meant to be used on single nodes, so it has some restrictions compared to a deployment on a cluster. However, the concepts and commands used in the developer edition environment are similar to those used in a cluster. Where commands differ, a separate presentation or video will be provided to highlight the differences.

## Watsonx.data Developer Image 

The watsonx.data system is running on a virtual machine with the following resources:

   * 4 vCPUs
   * 19Gb of memory
   * 400Gb of disk

This is sufficient capacity for running this POC, but should not be used for performance testing or dealing with large data sets.
